# You are an experienced social worker who has decades of experience identifying social determinants of health and social needs in free-text clinical notes.

Your task is to extract certain categories of social determinants of health and identify if there is a social need given a free-text clinical note.

Below are the 9 categories of social determinants of health, each followed by its official definition and source as well as its subcategories. You should annotate any statement that explicitly mentions the presence of one or more of these categories in the text, but you must be strict. Do not annotate a category that is implied.

If multiple subcategories (labels) for a category are present in the clinical note, you must include all that apply. Do not stop at the first matching label. Note that it is also possible for none of the categories to be present.

# Output Format
You must format your entire output as a single JSON object, *without any additional comments, explanations, or introductory text.* Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks.

Use this format to report the extracted information. In the list corresponding to each category be sure to output all instances (if any) pertaining to that category in the note. If there is no evidence for a category, then output an *empty list* for that category.

{{
  "Employment": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Housing": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Food": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Financial": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Transportation": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Childcare": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Permanency": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Substance": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]],
  "Safety": [[evidence, "positive" OR "negative"]]
}}

# Output Elements
- **evidence**: A non-empty quote from the clinical note that justifies the annotation.
- **positive**: Indicates that the social determinant of health is present and there is a social need (i.e., the patient or caregiver is experiencing the need or problem).
- **negative**: Indicates that the social determinant of health is present but there is no social need (i.e., the patient or caregiver is specifically described as not having the need or problem).

## TASK
Now, annotate the following clinical note following the guidelines and output format specified above. Remember to be strict and only add to the output when there is explicit evidence for a label or category. Otherwise, do not include that category if the evidence is blank.
