## Annotation Rules: 
- Keep asking the question “Is there a social need here?” We are not annotating interventions. 
- Do not make assumptions or leap to conclusions during annotation. Focus on what is stated and whether there are any social needs represented by that statement. Information may be interesting or important to the patient, but if it does not reflect information regarding our predetermined categories of social needs, do not annotate.  
- Annotate full sentence consistently (full sentences end at ; and . )  
- When multiple lines are related to each other for the same social need, annotate all together.  
- Denote negative examples 
- When there are flowsheet rows with yes/no answers, and the answer is no or yes without a comment, do not annotate. If there is a “yes” answer with comments, highlight it with the comment below, if the comment is on the following line.  
- If there is a note with no social needs found, highlight the entire note and choose the category “NoSocialNeedsFound.” No social needs found should only be highlighted in a whole note and not segments of a note that includes social needs 
- Use the attribute “speculation” when there is an “if clause” conditional for the social need.   
- Sleep rooms, laundry, and other hospital amenities, are not considered social needs.   
- Pre-school and daycare are considered to be “child care” while school is not.
- Child tobacco/vaping is not considered to be a substance use/social need.
- SSI (Supplemental Security Income) is not considered a social need/financial strain unless specifically noted.
- Assisting with FMLA paperwork can be considered a social need/employment (negated) based on the context.   
- RTF (Residential Treatment Facility) is considered social need/permanent placement pending.
- Secondary insurance should be coded as “social need/lack of insurance (negated).”
- Only highlight DHS involvement if there is a specific social need  (i.e. do not highlight an individual line if the sentence only lists the DHS caseworker name and/or number). Continue to practice the rule of highlighting corresponding lines if relevant to the note. 
- Visitor restriction would be included within Home environment-other 
- Annotate “Distance from hospital” if the note mentions that the family lives +1hr from CHOP and/or documented stressors/barriers relating to distance to CHOP. 
- Receiving financial assistance for adoption/fostering = financial strain negated  
- For concrete resource (Rideshare (Lyft/Uber), Bus tokens, Cab fare, Meal Vouchers, Parking Passes, Medication Coverage, clothes, travel hygiene) documentation: If the documenter does not identify a specific reason for a CR distribution (i.e. approved 5 meal vouchers) annotate as “Financial Strain-Other, Resolution in Progress." 
- Child Care: Unless mentioning specific barriers into visiting bedside, do NOT annotate/mark as negated for examples that would include “parent visiting bedside and/or parent not currently bedside” 
- Only annotate negated social needs if there are other social needs found in the note -When parent plans to start their job soon = employment/negated. Should a note only consist of negated needs, the whole note is highlighted as “no social needs found."
- When parent plans to start their job soon = employment/negated 
- Childcare barrier: not highlighted unless specific mention of barrier (ie unable to visit because of siblings, sickness, job, etc)
