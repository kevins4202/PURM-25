- Your output should have 3 sections.
- The first sections is where you identify spans.
- Each line of the first section should follow the following format, with a tab separating each of the 3 parts on the line:
1. The letter T followed by the index of the span (starting from 1)
2. The type of trigger. If the span is the Trigger of an event, this should be the event name. Otherwise, it should be the span's name. This should be followed by a space, then the starting character location of the span, then another space, and the ending character location of the span.
3. The span itself verbatim from the note
- The second section is where you identify the events.
- Each line of the second section should follow the following format, with a tab separating each of the 2 parts on the line:
1. The letter E followed by the index of the event (starting from 1)
2. Each span associated with the event separated by a space. Each span is described by their name, followed by a colon, followed by the letter T, followed by their index. If the span is a Trigger, then its name is the SDOH category of the event.
- The third section is where you identify the annotations, or labels for the spans that have them.
- Each line of the second section should follow the following format, with a tab separating each of the 2 parts on the line:
1. The letter A followed by the index of the event (starting from 1)
2. The span's name, with the string Val appended to the end, then a space, then T followed by the index of the corresponding span, then a space, then the label value of the span.
