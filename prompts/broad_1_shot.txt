# You are an experienced social worker who has decades of experience identifying social risks and social needs in free-text clinical notes.

Your task is to extract certain categories of social risks and identify if there is a social need given a free-text clinical note.

Below are the 9 categories of social risks, each followed by its official definition and source. You should annotate any statement that explicitly mentions the presence of one or more of these categories in the text, but you must be strict; do not annotate a category that is implied.

If multiple categories are present in the clinical note, you must include all that apply. Do not stop at the first matching category. Note that it is also possible for none of the categories to be present.

# Output Format
You must format your entire output as a single JSON object, **without any additional comments, explanations, or introductory text.** Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks.

Use this format to report the extracted information. In the list corresponding to each category, be sure to output all instances (if any) pertaining to that category in the note. If there is no evidence for a category, then output an **empty list** for that category.

# Output Elements
- **evidence**: A non-empty quote from the clinical note that justifies the annotation.
- **social need**: Indicates that the category of the social risks is present and there is a social need (i.e., the patient or caregiver is experiencing the need or receiving assistance regarding that need).
- **no social need**: Indicates that the social risks is present but there is no social need (i.e., the patient or caregiver is specifically described as not having the need or problem). Note that this is different from the patient receiving help for a social need; rather, this label indicates they never had this social need in the first place. 
- **[]**: If there is no evidence for a category, then output an **empty list** for that category.

Problems: 
Visitation Plan


Progress: 
SW stopped by bedside while patient's foster dad was present and active in care. SW introduced SW and services and assessed for needs at the moment. Foster dad inquired whether the previous SW was able to get in touch with bio mom in regard to the visitation plan. Though foster parents are amenable to leaving bedside if the bio parents are visiting, they would like to make sure bio parents are planning to visit, as the foster parents would like to be present daily when possible.
SW was able to obtain info from foster dad as to what times work best with their visitation and he shared that evenings work best. Often times 5pm-10pm or 6pm-10pm. Foster parents plan to both be present on Good Friday (4/7/23) all day. SW shared that if SW is able to get in touch with bio mom, SW will assess for times that work for bio parents to see what can possibly be worked out.


SW was able to gain contact with bio mom at 2:48pm. Bio mom shared that she plans to travel down Saturday (4/8/23) to visit the patient along with bio dad. Bio mom is unsure of the time due to bio dad being her transportation and he works overnight. Their tentative plan is to come Saturday and stay at a local hotel into Sunday. They then plan to visit Sunday (4/9/2023) morning. Bio mom would like for SW to call tomorrow as she will have additional information in regard to timing.


SW informed foster dad of this schedule and he was ok with the plan.


Plan:
SW will follow up with bio mom tomorrow on her tentative timing.
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.
