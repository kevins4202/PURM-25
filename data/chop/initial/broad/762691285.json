Kelli shared that at this moment, patient is still not able to be discharged to mom when the time comes. Kelli shared that she is trying to get in contact with patient's father to see if he would be appropriate for patient's discharge planning, as he is active in patient's life. SW inquired about patient's grandmother, as she has been present at bedside, and Kelli shared that she will reach out to grandmother to see if this option can be explored as well.
