This meeting went over the discharge plan to see what all is needed in order for the patient to be discharged safely. Home nursing and medical day care had been addressed along with the extensive timeline that comes with it. DHS was updated on the status of each option as the patient had been approved by insurance but is currently on the waiting list for both due to staffing issues Clarity on patient's at home needs with feeds had also been covered. Both of the identified aunts, Latifah and Kiesha Reddy, work schedules had been brought up and DHS had concerns and would like for there to be a set plan as to who can help and at what times before the patient is discharged. The concern is primarily for night feedings, as the patient is fed every 3 hours. Aunts do not live in the same household so they would like for a plan to be put together for support. The patient's 18 year old sibling, who lives at the home with Latifah, had been brought up for discussion to see if she was mature enough to be trained and assist aunt with the patient in the event aunt may need a break. DHS will explore if this is possible and will let CHOP staff know. Aunt is still willing to take a leave from work, but DHS would like clarity as to how long she is willing to stay out of work since the timeline for at home services cannot be confirmed. CUA and DHS nursing mentioned possible nursing visits, whether it is virtual and/or in person. Both parties plan to look into additional information to see if it will be avaible to the family based on staffing and placement type. It had also been reccommended that aunts do an additional 12 hour stay overnight to be familiar with night time feeds and care.", "social need"]], "Permanency": []}
