RMH staff plans to have a meeting about the family with their management as there has been ongoing concerns and conversations with the family about their lack of supervision with Jennie while at RMH. The lack of supervision has become a problem as it is not safe for Jennie and other families. There is also a strict mask policy that has also not been followed by the family while at the house. RMH plans to have their meeting today and then also meet with the family. If family does not comply after the final meeting, it is likely that they will be asked to leave RMH and will no longer be able to stay there in the future.", "social need"]], "FoodInsecurity": [], "FinancialStrain": [], "Transportation": [], "Childcare": [], "Permanency": [], "SubstanceAbuse": [], "Safety": []}
