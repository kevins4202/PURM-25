It had also been brought to everyone's attention during the meeting that DHS has not obtained clearances for maternal grandmother. DHS plans to work with grandmom to obtain clearances. At this time, maternal aunt, Latifah Reddy, is the only one officially cleared as a caregiver. Patient is medically clear to go on CHOP's end and is just waiting for DHS to confirm their requirements for discharge. Once the additional caregiver is cleared and idenfitied by DHS, this information will be shared with SW and the medical team so that the caregiver can complete their training and the 12 or 24 hour stay, in order for the patient to be safely discharge. Plan: SW will follow up with DHS to obtain information on maternal grandmother's clearances and 3rd idenfitied caregiver.", "social need"]], "SubstanceAbuse": [], "Safety": []}
