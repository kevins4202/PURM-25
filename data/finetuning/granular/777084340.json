CYS relayed that the outcome of the court hearing was disposition to Mom, pending Mom's program (Vantage House) accepting the pt to live there. Per CYS, they provide consent for the pt due to him being in foster care and in the custody of Lancaster County CYS. SW spoke with CM James who spoke with the program director who shared the information that they need provided to them in letter in order to make a determination to accept the pt to live in their program's house. CYS reports that another court hearing is not needed after the determination of Vantage House. Once Vantage House makes a decision, CYS should be notified and will inform CHOP of next steps for disposition.", "social need"]], "SubstanceAbuse": [], "Safety": []}
