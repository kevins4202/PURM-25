The e-mail stated: "Thank you so much for your call and voicemail yesterday. Yes - I am in touch with the family and we are currently assessing their options for extending their stay in the United States. I will likely need some updated letters reflecting the ongoing medical needs of the children once itâ€™s time to renew their visa extension. However, it is best to have the most updated information when we file, so I will reach back out to you as we get closer to that deadline. In the meantime, as I told Ms. Alvarado and Mr. Murillo, they can get a head start on gathering the funds for the filing fee of $540." No additional information is needed at this time from SW. Plan: SW will inform parents of this information provided to SW by their immigration lawyer. SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU. Time Spent: 15 minutes Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning Electronically signed: Aisha Evans 5/10/2023	10:54 AM
