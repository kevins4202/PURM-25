Mom shared about the family meeting yesterday and that she has decided to go through with the surgery for Yari. Mom shared that she had to leave last night for her appointment on Saturday due to it being the only day her niece could pick her up from CHOP. Previously, SW was going to provide Mom the request from SSI to provide to her eye doctor directly when she attended her appointment. SW agreed to fax this over to their office, since Mom has already left and will not return until after the appointment. Mom asked how Yari was doing today. SW added CCRN to the call who provided brief updates. Plan: SW will continue to follow.
