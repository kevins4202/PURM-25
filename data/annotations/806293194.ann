SW inquired if team should expect supervised visit with mother and father on 6/12 at 10am. Ashley reports parents have yet to confirm planned visit and if they do not confirm with the agency, visit will not take place. Ashley reports she will update SW if parents confirm and explained that if visit does take place it will be supervised by an agency case aid rather than herself.
