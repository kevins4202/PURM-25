Mom shared that she applied for PH 95 and was told she would have heard back by now, but her application still says that it is in process. SW relayed that sometimes there is backup in reviewing applications. SW provided Mom with contact information if she would like to call and ask directly when she can expect a decision on the application. SW provided SW phone number and email address at Mom's request. Mom also asked about SLP after discharge. SW briefly discussed Early Intervention. SW shared that SW is unsure what the team's recommendations will be for discharge for therapies, but that EI could be one avenue to receive therapies. Mom asked about the process of getting connected with this, which SW relayed the team could place a referral at discharge. Plan: SW will continue to follow.
