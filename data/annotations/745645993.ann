Parents shared their concern for all that Giselle has gone through and their worry that she is suffering.  They worry that her swelling, complications and surgergies may be too much.  Family asked questions about what Giselle's life would look like if she were to survive this acute time period.  It was shared that while it is hard to predict, given her medical complexity that she is at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, need for long term respiratory support as well as a lengthy hospitalization. Mirabel shared that while she worries about her daughter's suffering she could not decide to take away the technological support keeping her alive at this time.  She asks that the teams be honest with her when they feel that Giselle should not continue treatments.  She shared that she doesn't want to force Giselle's body to go through things it cannot handle.  PACT MD Parikh discussed limitations of care (no CPR) which both parents agreed would be best to protect Giselle. They are open to hearing more about the next recommended surgery and would like to be thoughtful about whether going forward with a procedure would make sense for their daughter.  Family was appropriately tearful throughout the conversation.  They reiterated that it is helpful to have guidance and recommendations from the medical team especially if Giselle is not tolerating therapies. Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with nicu sw.
