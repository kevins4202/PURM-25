CRNP updated mom on patient's status and the plan for the coming days. Mom had a question about one of patient's medications which CRNP was able to answer. SW then talked with mom about the importance of not only calling, but coming in to visit with patient. SW explained that parents need to be present a lot more at bedside so they can begin to learn her care and be an active participant. Patient' mother stated that she would talk with patient's father and let him know as well. Mom also had a question about patient's insurance and SW directed mom back to FHCP. Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support.
