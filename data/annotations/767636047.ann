Patient's mother continues to cope well given the circumstances. LSW collaborated with Child Life to order gifts from the Snowflake station for Gisselle and her brother. Gisselle's mother would like for the DNR to be reinitiated. The parents do not want to "force" Gisselle to do anything and do not want to cause any additional suffering. Parents would like to discuss this further with the medical team next week at a family meeting. Gisselle requested that the Attending call her tomorrow at 4 pm to discuss the DNR.
