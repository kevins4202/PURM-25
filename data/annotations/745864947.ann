T1	HomeEnvironment_Other 537 987	SW consulted for support around visitation. Per report, biological father, Darius Gains, called last night (9/14/2022) requesting to visit patient at bedside. Request deferred until clarification around visitation was obtained from the current DCP&P team. SW spoke with Jillian Hauber (609-649-9666), DCP&P Supervisor, for clarification. Please note that father is not restricted, therefore stating he is authorized to visit Mason while hospitalized.
