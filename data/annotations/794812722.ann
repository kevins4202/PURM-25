Twin sister Addison and older brother TK were also at bedside.  Parents expressed that this past weekend was difficult but they are hopeful she will be able to try her respiratory sprints again soon.  They hold hope that she can improve so that they can get home together as a family and feel worried that she doesn't seem to be improving.  Parents expressed that they are hopeful to optimize anything they can for Aubree and that sometimes it feels hard to feel like she's stuck in the same cycles here at the hospital..  They don't want people to "give up" on Aubree and want the team to think about what we can do differently that might support her.  Parents express worry that she hasn't been able to see outside of the hospital and worry how hard that must be for her to have the same view and environment day after day.  They want to be thoughtful about giving Aubree time to prove what she can do before jumping to something like a tracheostomy right away.  Parents express that there may be a family meeting next week - PACT can plan to be present for that meeting if helpful. Plan: PACT SW will follow up with PICU SW Weiss.  PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with picu sw.
