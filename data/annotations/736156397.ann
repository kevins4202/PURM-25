Mother and MGM have expressed dissatisfaction with the care at CHOP and have indicated that they would like to have the patient transferred to a hospital of their preference in New York City, despite the efforts of involved Staff/multiple inpatient providers efforts to convince the family to allow the patient to remain at CHOP with the recommended plan of care. Progress: Ongoing. This SW has been a part of two(2) meetings led by Gen Peds and other Specialists with the mother and joined later on each occasion with the PGM on the phone attempting to reassure the family that the patient is receiving the best possible care at CHOP. SW has witnessed and been a part of attempts by the Care Teams involved with efforts to explain in detail about the patient's status and the need to move forward with a plan of care that is felt to be the best options to treat the patient ASAP, however, the family prefers a transfer to another hospital so aggressive efforts are being made to accommodate the family's wishes. The family was informed that there may be delay with transfer to a preferred hospital until the hospital indicates after acceptance for transfer, an open bed for the patient. Plan: SW will continue to be available for supportive counseling whenever the family needs and desires the assistance. Time Spent: 120 minutes Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required Electronically signed: Raymond Hendricks, MSW 7/29/2022	3:48 PM
