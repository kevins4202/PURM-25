T1	HomeEnvironment_Other 281 478;482 702	Plan: PICU SW put in for meal vouchers and emailed the DCPP team assigned to Valerie about her transfer to the floor. In the email I also CC'd Terri Alli-Hadi out pt Rheumatology SW about the case. It will be important that SW Make sure there is a medical update to both the worker and DCPP RN weekly and that they know when she will be D/C'd.  Valerie per DCPP can go home with mom and they will follow-up from there.
