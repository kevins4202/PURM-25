T8	PermanentPlacementPending 3136 3838	Mom shared about her experiences with St. Edmond's since Faatema transferred there in August, which have not been positive. Mom had previously cared for Faatema at home with home nursing, but ultimately decided to transition her to St. Edmond's due to frequent home nursing call-outs. Mom asked about other facilities, which SW briefly discussed other local options. Mom interested in looking into other facilities potentially. SW encouraged Mom to look into other places if she would like, and we can put in referrals if she chooses. SW discussed that LTCF have very long wait lists right now, so in the meantime, we can focus on creating a good plan moving forward with St. Edmond's. Mom in agreement
