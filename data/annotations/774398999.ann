Mom shared about her immense worry for Yaseen at all times and that lately, she has been having dreams, in which she falls asleep when she is supposed to be monitoring him at night and she doesn't put his BIPAP back on and he dies. SW reflected back how much this has been impacting her. Mom expressed how she has to hold so much more worry for him, since she is the only one who cares for him. Mom shared that she would never want to agree to something that wound up hurting Yaseen. SW encouraged Mom to write down the thoughts, concerns, and questions she has about Yaseen and to try to leave them on the paper, rather than ruminate on them so much. SW also discussed making a referral to BHIP who can provide caregiver support with helping Mom process these worries and assist with coping support. Mom has shared with SW several times that her blood pressure has been very high from stress. Mom confirmed that she has been monitoring this with her doctor and he also continues to express the importance of her getting support for her stress. Mom was very open to this referral.
