At approx. 2:30pm Mom requested via nursing that SW and Falguni Patal, CNS to come to bedside to discuss the specifics/ better understand the overnight events/ visitor restriction.  Upon covering SW and CNS meeting with mom at bedside, mom displayed that dad was already on facetime via mom's phone and wanted to address the visitor restrictions as well.  SW and CNS acknowledged that since things escalated to security and hospital management, and they were the individuals who set restriction to remain in place until further discussions/ "cool off" period are addressed.  Dad and mom became audibly upset articulating not understanding why "dad wouldn't be allowed to see his child/ hold his baby".  SW attempted to state the nature of a full restriction and that this was due to concerning/ threatening behaviors that were addressed overnight/ yesterday.  Parents focused on videos they have, previous meetings, and a family relations report they made today to addressed their major concern related to nursing care/ appropriate staff interaction at bedside.  Dad noted that he didn't understand why "a comment" could get him restricted but staff are allowed to come back to work.  SW and CNS acknowledged the difficulty for ability to have a calm conversation/ find resolution with this interaction.  Mom requested to meet with the management staff that are in control of keeping dad restricted.
