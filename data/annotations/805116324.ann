SW validated dad's feelings and encouraged dad to give himself grace as it is never easy being a first time parent but his fatherly instincts will kick in. SW also encouraged dad to reach out for assistance from his support system and other professionals in the event he feels as though it is too much. Dad ultimately shared that he wants to be the best dad he can be. Dad shared his big plans for when the patient gets older and all of the trips he wants to take him on. Dad shared he is ultimately prepared for the patient and ready to go home today. Covering SW walked with dad to obtain the meal vouchers. SW assessed for additional needs at the moment and none were identified. SW encouraged dad to reach out if any needs arise. Plan: SW will continue to assist while covering. Time Spent: 60 minutes Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required Electronically signed: Aisha Evans 6/5/2023	10:06 AM
