T1	PermanentPlacementPending 2944 3706	Mom shared that she understands Yaribeth may have to go to a LTCF if Mom is unable to safely care for her at home. Mom's primary concerns with Yaribeth going to a LTCF is that she will be unable to visit her due to not having any means of transportation. Mom also would want to be with Yaribeth every day and would be worried about the LTCF only letting her visit at a scheduled time, or only for one hour. SW discussed that SW is unsure of Children's Specialized's visitation policies, but does know that Mom would not be able to sleepover. Mom is okay with that, but again expressed concerns about how she would be able to go and see Yaribeth. SW discussed the LTCF being a bridge to home as Mom completes her eye procedures and identifies longer term support.
