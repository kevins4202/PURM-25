Dr. Callaway informed parents that the patient's pulmonary hypertension has improved, Camden was transitioned to VCV and weaned off of Nitric. An Echo will be done this week to evaluate the Pulmonary Hypertension and the patient's PDA. Parents were made aware that the patient's PDA is small and will likely not require intervention. Dr. Callaway informed the parents that the patient has Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity. Education was provided on CLD and the possibility of the patient being transferred to the NIICU's Yellow team was discussed. Over the next couple of week, respiratory weans will be made as tolerated with the goal of a trial extubation. Parent's were made aware of that Camden will require a steroid course prior to extubation. It was explained to parents that given Camden prematurity and CLD he will likely be hospitalized for a long time. The patient's parents asked thoughtful and appropriate questions during the meeting and demonstrate their understanding of Camden's medical needs. LSW met with the patient's parents after the family meeting while Camden was being held by dad. LSW provided education on applying for SSI and followed up via email with further instructions on how to apply. LSW provided information on parking and the NIICU visitation policy to help orient them to the hospital. Parents requested resources to help quit smoking. LSW reached out to the Respiratory therapist who provided the patient's parents with education and will enroll them in the smoking cessation program. Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support while Camden is hospitalized.
