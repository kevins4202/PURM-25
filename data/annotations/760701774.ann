Yaseen was asleep during the call, so SW agreed to do another call with Mom later today. Mom was very grateful to see Yaseen and that he looked comfortable sleeping. Addendum 2:30pm: SW informed that Dad is requesting that step mother be added to the visitors list. CCRN and SW reached out to Mom due to visitors list being full, to share that if step mother is added to the list, someone on the list will need to come off. Upon reading off the names, Mom relayed that step mother is already on the list (Fathia Farag). Mom was upset due to not wanting step mother to visit. Mom also did not know the other name on the list (Gahda Salah). Mom expressed that she does not want visitors that she does not know visiting her son. SW to look into visitor policy, as it does not appear that Mom had a voice in the visitors list. Parents share 50/50 custody of Yaseen. SW will follow up with Mom and Dad regarding the visitors list.
