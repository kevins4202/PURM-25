Mom noted that they were adequately resolved at this time, and parents were happy procedure went well today as dad was in a planned wedding and mom was at hospital alone which mom noted wasn't ideal but they appreciated support.  Mom noted that she did have billing issues with medicaid potentially not being retroactive to DOB.  SW noted to clarify with FHCP and admissions and get back to mom.
