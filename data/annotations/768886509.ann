Dr. Taha explained that the goal at this point is to get Gisselle to full feeds and off of the IV nutriiton. The medical team plans to increase Gisselle's feeds every other day as she tolerates it. Once Gisselle is on full feeds, her respiratory support can be weaned in hopes of extubating her. Gisselle's swelling may not get better until she is extubated and weaning on her respiratory support. IRP Attending Dr. Sainath informed parents that Gisselle has 55 centimeters of bowel which is a strong indicator that Gisselle will not need IV nutrition. Feeds will be increased in small increments and the IV  nutrition will be reduced while evaluating the patient's growth. Dr. Sainath explained to parents that it will likely take months for Gisselle to be on full feeds and off the IV nutrition given all the she has been through. Gisselle's pain medication will be reduced in the coming days as she appears to be comfortable and more interactive. Gisselle's mother asked if the medical team believes that Gisselle will survive. Dr. Taha explained that at this point the medical team is not concerned that Gisselle will die but they are unsure what kind of support she will need. Dr. Taha explained that Gisselle has Chronic Lung Disease of prematurity and that it can take many months to years for it to get better. If Gisselle is unable to be extubated within the next few months she may need a Tracheostomy. The patient's parents demonstrated an understanding of the information shared and asked thoughtful and appropraite questions. LSW met with the patient's parents at the bedside following the meeting to provide emotional support. The patient's parents are coping well given the circumstances. Plan: LSW will continue to follow and assess needs throught Gisselle's hospitalization.
