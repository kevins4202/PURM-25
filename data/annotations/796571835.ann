Parents expressed understandable frustration with how lengthy this hospitalization has been for Aubree and how they have not gotten to be home together as a family.  This is exhausting.  They express feeling sick and wondering how things will change for Aubree so that she can get home.  Parents express frustration in not always feeling heard by the medical teams caring for Aubree.  They have questions about her recent fevers, why she can't be able to go outside etc that they are hoping can be answered in tomorrow's family meeting.  Parents met with PICU SW Weiss prior and created a list of questions for the meeting.  Lashay also had further questions about the possibility of a tracheostomy.  While parents are hopeful Aubree will not need this, they do want to hear additional information about possible pros and cons. PACT SW recognized that the family had been hoping to be home by the end of April and seeing that this time period might be difficult. PACT communicated with PICU SW Weiss to collaborate support. Plan: PACT will plan to be present at tomorrow's meeting.
