T1	PermanentPlacementPending 403 1010	SW shared that Voorhees is coming to see Yari tomorrow to do an assessment and see if she could be a good fit for their LTCF. Mom asked a lot of questions about the LTCF. Mom's primary concern is that when she wants to take Yari home, they will not let her. SW discussed this concern with Mom, but also encouraged her to share this with Voorhees to hear directly from them. At this time, Mom continues to strongly consider LTCF for Yari while Mom gets better and finds a better home for them. Mom continues to struggle with the idea of being away from Yari and fears that the LTCF will not let Yari go home.
