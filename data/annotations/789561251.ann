Lashay shared that Aubree unfortunately failed her sprint this morning but she wonders if this was because it was completed in the morning when she usually has increased secretions.  Lashay is hopeful to hear more from the team about goal discharge date.  She recognizes how long Aubree has been in the hospital and is hopeful that they can be home together as a family soon.
