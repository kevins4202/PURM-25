The patient's mother shared that it would be helpful to meet with the medical team later today to talk about Leo's plan of care and prognosis. The patient's father does not want to talk about comfort care and wants to continue with all medical interventions to help Leo. Leo's father identified his Islamic faith as a source of influence in his decision making. A family meeting was held with Attending Karen Puopolo MD, Eric Wall PA-C, Katherine Dougherty CRNP, PACT Attending Shefali Parikh MD, PACT Fellow Erika Meija MD, LSW and Leo's parents. Dr. Puopolo provided an overall medical update and explained that because Leo was born at 22 weeks he has faced multiple complications in his hospital course. Dr. Puopolo explained to the patient's mother that Leo will likely be TPN dependent for many years given the state of his stomach. Furthermore, it was explained that Leo will likely require respiratory support for many months. At this time it is hard to tell if he will require that support after discharge. Leo's mother was made aware that if the patient requires respiratory support at home it could be with a nasal canula or he may require a tracheostomy. The patient's mother asked how Leo's brain damage will affect his development. Dr. Puopolo explained that at this time it cannot be said with certainty his exact needs but that Leo will have cognitive delays and is at risk for Cerebral Palsy. Leo's mother was appropriately tearful during the family meeting and asked thoughtful questions related to Leo's care and prognosis. LSW will continue to support the patient's parents to ensure they understand the medical teams update and continued plan of care. LSW will continue to support both parents in ways specific to their coping needs. LSW met with the patient's mother following the meeting to provide emotional support and supportive counseling. Plan: LSW will continue to follow and assess needs Time Spent: 150 minutes Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.
