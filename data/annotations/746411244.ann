SW spoke with CYS SW, Sandy Jones, 610-829-4643, who reported that there is a Hearing scheduled for later this week when it's expected that the current Safety Plan(patient being released to the father and residing with him and the PGF) will become a legal Protective Order in addition to the CYS Safety Plan. Ms. Jones reported that the change to the father occurred last week and that she established that with both parents. The mother will not be allowed to stay at the father's house and her contacts with the patient will always need to be supervised by the father and the PGF.
