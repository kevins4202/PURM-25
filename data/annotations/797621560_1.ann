T1	FinancialStrain_Other 911 1393	Mom shared a letter she received in the mail with SW that is a shut off notice for her PSEG. Mom has already went to Mercer County Social Services for utility assistance and completed a form with them. They provided Mom with a phone number to call to set up an appointment to finalize the application, but Mom was unable to read the phone number. SW and Mom called this number together, but was advised that their staff was on lunch. They encouraged us to call back at another time.
