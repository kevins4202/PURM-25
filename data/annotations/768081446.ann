T2	PermanentPlacementPending 623 630;632 1128	Update: Kelli returned SW call at 9:55am and informed SW that maternal grandmother clearances did not clear so she can no longer be the identified caregiver during the day. DHS is now working on 2 additional family supports to assist aunt in taking care of the patient. DHS is exploring the additional maternal aunt that had been identified by the family during the discharge planning meeting on 12/23/22, but they still have to find an additional caregiver for night or day, due to aunt's work schedule.
