T1	FinancialStrain_Other 250 596;598 733	SW contacted patient's parents via phone who had questions in regards to their medical bills. Dad shared that they have not yet received a bill but they would like to be ahead of it as the patient has been inpatient longer than they expected and they can forsee it being a financial burden. Dad is interested in financial assistance with billing. SW provided dad with CHOP's billing's department contact for future reference as well as CHOP's Pre-Visit Financial Counseling Hotline.
