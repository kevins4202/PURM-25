T1	LackofFundsforFood 477 857	Discussed formula for discharge; pt is registered for WIC. Mom will make an appt closer to discharge. We discussed purchasing a can to last until the WIC appt. Mom has some at home and will let SW know what kind it is, to see if it can be used while awaiting her WIC appt. Pt is on Similac Neosure, which will require a prescription form. SW will fax WIC form closer to discharge.
