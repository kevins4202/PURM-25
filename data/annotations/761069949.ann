SW discussed visitation policy and questions. Due to parents sharing 50/50 custody, both parents must approve any changes or additions to the visitors list. SW relayed that Yaseen is still asleep at this time, so SW will keep Mom updated when he wakes up to coordinate a video call with them today. Mom is aware that SW will be off on Thursday and Friday. Addendum 3:30pm: SW coordinated a video call with Mom. Upon arrival, MT was doing a session with Yaseen, which Mom was able to be a part of. Yaseen was engaged with MT throughout. Mom sang Yaseen a song that MT played music to. Mom was tearful throughout and expressed many times how much she loves and misses Yaseen. Mom was very grateful to take part of the MT session and see Yaseen. SW offered to reach out on Monday when SW returns. Plan: SW will continue to follow.
