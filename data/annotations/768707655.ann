T1	LackofInsurance 30 53;55 139;141 157;161 929	Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS Goal: Patient will have adequate insurance coverage to obtain necessary medical care Outcome: Ongoing Progress:  SW called mom via language line.  SW checked in with mom regarding overall coping and specifically addressed inability for mom to reach NJ Medicaid office or make call with Stephanie Gerkovich from FHCP for advocacy for issues with application.  Mom noted wanting to call Stephanie and NJ after 4pm which SW advised to contact both parties before 4pm as these offices close around that time.  Mom noted frustration (through interpreter) "keep getting phone calls about insurance when my baby has never been home and in the hospital for 4 months".  SW apologized as goal was to support and help mom, and for this very reason of baby's age and without insurance that is a major issue.  Mom noted she would call NJ tomorrow and ended the phone call on her own.
