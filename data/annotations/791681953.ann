T4	HomeEnvironment_Other 248 731;733 1119	SW stopped by bedside while patient's foster dad was present and active in care. SW introduced SW and services and assessed for needs at the moment. Foster dad inquired whether the previous SW was able to get in touch with bio mom in regard to the visitation plan. Though foster parents are amenable to leaving bedside if the bio parents are visiting, they would like to make sure bio parents are planning to visit, as the foster parents would like to be present daily when possible. SW was able to obtain info from foster dad as to what times work best with their visitation and he shared that evenings work best. Often times 5pm-10pm or 6pm-10pm. Foster parents plan to both be present on Good Friday (4/7/23) all day. SW shared that if SW is able to get in touch with bio mom, SW will assess for times that work for bio parents to see what can possibly be worked out.
