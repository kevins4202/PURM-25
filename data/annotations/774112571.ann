His brother is present with the parents which requires support because he was born via c section so their mom is recovering in the SDU. At 4 pm, with an in person interpreter, the parents were provided an update about the baby’s condition. The team expressed that they are concerned that his lungs may not be able to sustain him since he is currently requiring so much support th at air is leaking out of the lungs. They discussed chest tubes, the oscillator ventilator, urologist placing a foley and also discussed that his lungs might not be able to support him in the short or long term. He could also have an event that he can’t recover from. They discussed all the possibilities. His dad came to the NICU afterward to visit him.
