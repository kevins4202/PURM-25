T1	LackofTransportation 157 396	Progress:  SW received a text from pt's mother yesterday that her ride didn't work out and she was not able to come in. She reported that she rescheduled class and requested assistance with transportation for her and dad for today at 5:00.
T2	LackofTransportation 1119 1366	Mom indicated she would have to see about a ride. In an effort to ensure mom can be at bedside the full amount of time needed for education, SW will approve a Lyft ride for her, but will need to discuss other options for future trips back to CHOP.
