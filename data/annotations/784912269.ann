MD Yuerek reviewed the results from the most recent cardiac catherization and what the numbers/pressures mean for Amayra.  He shared that unfortunately due to her pressures that Amayra is not a candidate for the planned Glenn surgery and that the concern is she will never be eligible for this surgery.  Parents shared their questions including "how will this be fixed if she can't have surgery" and "if she doesn't have surgery, how long can she survive?".  MD Yuerek shared that the team can continue doing a cardiac catheterization every couple of months but at some point, this will no longer work.  He also shared his concern for Amayra's respiratory status and that she may not be able to breathe without the ventilatory support.  Plan is to work toward a wean and see if Amayra can tolerate extubation.  MD Yuerek relayed that there may need to be conversations in the future regarding tracheostomy.  Parents acknowledged how difficult all of this information was to hear.  Plan to have further discussions next week. Plan: PACT SW will continue to offer support in conjunction with cardiology SW Greberman.
