T1	HomeEnvironment_Other 240 654;658 765	Progress: SW spoke with mom and dad. I asked about the lack of training the last 2 days. Dad tried to stated that they were in today but they were not. Dad also stated that they spoke to the "training lady" on Monday 3/20/23 (I think this must of been Morganne) and are signed up for training next Monday, 3/27 which he remembered was patient's birthday. Parents confirmed they will not be in the rest of the week. SW sent email to the DHS worker to provide update on lack of training, and parent involvement with patient.
