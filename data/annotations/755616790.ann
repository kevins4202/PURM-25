T4	NeedofChildcare 853 1651	Mom also discussed disposition planning for Yaseen. Mom clarified that she will be bed-ridden for 2 weeks post surgery (until 11/17), but her doctor also informed her mobility and activity should be extremely limited until 2 months post-surgery (1/3/2023). Thus, mom will not be able to care for Yaseen until 1/23/2022. Mom discussed that she has been approved for 10 hours overnight (9pm-7am) and Yaseen will be in school from 7am-3pm, but Mom will need that 3-9pm shift covered by nursing during her recovery time. Mom expressed that there is no one else who can care for Yaseen, or help her. Mom identified a neighbor who is a nurse, but she is only able to stop by for a short amount of time, not for hours at a time.

T6	CommunityAccessibility 2044 2580	Addendum 2pm: SW spoke with Amanda Synder (610-755-9479) who is the Intermediate Unit Coordinator through North Penn School District. Amanda discussed that Yaseen has not been to school in several years due to no nursing staffed in the school and issues with his stroller. Per Amanda, stroller issues have been resolved. Amanda discussed that staffing was available, but then he was admitted to the hospital, so she is unsure if that staffing is still available. Amanda requested a tentative discharge date so she can check on staffing.
T7	NeedofChildcare 2585 2779	Amanda suggested Firely Medical Daycare in Harleysville, PA for after school care, given that even if nurses are staffed, they could call out last minute and Mom would be unable to care for him.
