T2	LackofInsurance 392 544;548 1077	SW provided hard copies of PAMA secondary medical documentation for application and will email electronic copies to cmkelley1992@gmail.com as requested. SW inquired with mom re: status of adding baby to primary insurance plan and mom stated that dad was adding to his plan through his family business which he was inquiring about today. SW advised that mom's policy will only cover pt's pediatrician visits for the first 30 days of life and that unfortunately, pt will not be able to get any medical supplies or see any specialists without her own plan, which could delay d/c. Mom understood and requested SW contact information in case dad has further questions which was provided.
