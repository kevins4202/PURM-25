SW met with foster mother and father (Megan and Luke Larsen) to assess needs. Foster mother (FM) expressed much concern around bio parents' visitation in the hospital. Per prior SW notes, foster parents have expressed this previously as well. SW shared that recommendations from CYS will be followed at this time. SW reviewed hospital guidelines and how units work to support patient safety at all times. SW discussed that if there are any safety concerns that present at bedside, further assessment and action would be taken as needed/appropriate. SW confirmed information provided by CYS Caseworker today (3 hour daily visitation permitted). SW later also obtained written confirmation uploaded to media tab. FM confirmed that she has received the same information. FM expressed frustration around communication with CYS as their recommendations around visitation have changed, which SW validated.
