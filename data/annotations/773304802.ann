SW was transferred to their SW Patty McGlone (215-227-2400) and left a message. SW later met with family at 3:30pm with VRI 750134, to check in at parents' request. Parents were excited to share the good news that they will receive assistance from one of our leads to extending their Visa. Parents provided SW with the number as they shared they are in need of a letter of support, in which SW will provide. They would like for SW to check in directly to see what all is needed. Parents shared they will need to submit a 539 immigration form for an extension and it will have to be submitted prior to 1/29/23. Mom also shared that they are set to go down to the NIICU Monday at 12pm and she wanted to make sure the SW in the NIICU is informed. SW shared that she will work with the SW in the NIICU and follow the family for support and mom was very appreciative. Plan: SW will continue to follow and collaborate with SW and family. SW will provide a letter of support and contact the resource for clarification on what is needed.
