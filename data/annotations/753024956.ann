T1	FinancialStrain_Other 114 350;354 489;493 563;567 725	Progress: SW spoke with ODF regarding ability to apply for rental assistance for both parents. ODF relayed that each child can only receive one grant, thus, it should go to the household that the pt primarily resides in, which is Mom's. SW provided a Spanish application to Mom at the bedside. SW will complete the medical/SW portion. Mom denied any questions or concerns. Addendum 4pm: Mom completed the parent portion of the ODF application. Plan: SW will work on the medical/SW section of the application and submit it once completed. Application is due 11/10 for considering for the December grants
