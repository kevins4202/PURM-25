Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  The patient's biological parents have been working with Lifeline Children's Services and planned to put the patient up for adoption. LSW spoke with the adoption agency social worker, Mary Kemp (470-869-1979), who has been working with the patient's parents. The adoptive parents are driving from Texas and will be in the Philadelphia area by tonight. 


LSW spoke with the patient's biological parents on the phone with the assistance of Mary Kemp to outline their wishes for visitation. The birth parents would like for the adoptive parents to visit the patient starting 6/14/23 and will provide them with the care code so that they can receive all medical updates. The birth parents are comfortable with the adoptive parents being present at the bedside and receiving all medical updates. 


At this time, the birth parents are responsible for providing consent. Once the patient is three days old, the adoption agency will provide documentation identifying the responsible consenting party. 


Birth parents; contact information is in the patient's chart and the adoptive parents have been added to the visitation list. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 180 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
