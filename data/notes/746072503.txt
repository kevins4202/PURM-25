SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing



Progress:  Social worker and NICU fellow Dr. Osborne spoke with mother by phone. Dr. Osborne provided a detailed update regarding the event that Treasure had on 9/15/2022. Answered mother's questions explaining the different types of events that premies may experience. Discussed that the medical team would like for Treasure to not have any events for 5 days before she can discharge home. Mother verbalized understanding. Social worker and NICU fellow encouraged parents to complete their discharge teaching for Treasure in the coming days so that once Treasure is medically stable for discharge, parents will be able to bring her home. Discussed that if it is too logistically challenging for parents to both be present for a 24 hour stay due to work and child care reasons, two 12 hour stays to complete Treasure's discharge teaching and learn her feeding cues would also be possible. Mother noted that parents had originally planned to come in for discharge teaching today. Mother shared that she plans to discuss further with father and will follow up with the medical team once parents know when they will be coming in to complete their discharge teaching. 




Plan: Social worker will continue to follow. Will continue to collaborate with NICU Yellow Team social worker, Qadriyyah Major, who is following Treasure's twin sister.
