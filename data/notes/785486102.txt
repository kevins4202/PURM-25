Progress:
LSW met with mom and Savannah at bedisde to offer ongoing SW support. 
LSW confirmed with UVA SW that there is no secondary MA program in VA. Mom expressed understanding.


LSW and mom also discussed school. LSW has been communicating with HSP education coordinator. School has un enrolled Savannah which mom agreed to because mom was told the only options were to unenroll Savannah or to face truancy since Savannah had been unable to sign on for all of her homebound virtual sessions due to her medical care needs. LSW and mom discussed with HSP teacher Maria that this is not what school should have done and school should be accommodating her medical needs. Mom gave LSW and HSP education coordinator permission to work with school to get Savannah re-enrolled with appropriate accommodations in place. 


Savannah shared feeling stress related to concerns that school won't understand what she is going through and will pressure her to get work done that she is not well enough to do. LSW expressed understanding that Savannah is a conscientious student and explained that SWer's role is to make sure school understands Savannah's medical status and to advocate for her. Savannah expressed understanding and shared this made her feel reassured. LSW encouraged Savannah to continue to share her stressors with the team. 


Plan: LSW will continue to follow patient and family to provide ongoing emotional support and concrete resources as needed. Please page with any questions or concerns #72440.
