SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE










Progress:  SW received call from NICU SW Kunkel, patient's previous SWer. Patient's mother reached out to SW Kunkel with current concerns. SW coordinated with nurse manager.  SW met with patient's mother at bedside. SW introduced herself and discussed SW role. Mother discussed concerns related to leaving the patient tomorrow. Patient has three older siblings at home. Mom expressed concern about not being able to watch the patient via bedside camera (like in the NICU).  SW provided emotional support via compassionate presence, active listening and mindful feedback. SW discussed nursing care while patient is on 9 South and discussed finding volunteer support to assist with attending to patient at bedside tomorrow. SW attempted to validate mom's concerns about leaving patient alone tomorrow. SW encouraged mother that team is here to support and encouraged mother to reach out to SW should any additional concerns arise. Mother confirmed understanding and confirmed she would reach out to SW, as needed.


Plan: SW will continue to follow and reassess needs throughout admission to 9 South. Social Work supports will be offered as appropriate throughout hospitalization.
