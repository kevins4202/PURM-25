Progress:  LSW met with the patient's parents throughout the week to provide emotional support. The patient's parents continue to cope appropriately with Bentley's hospitalization and are actively implementing strategies to promote healthy coping. The patient's parents shared their thoughts and feelings surrounding Bentley's care and prognosis. Parents shared that they are feeling hopeful that Bentley will be able to come home one day. The past few weeks they have not felt this way which has caused increased stress and anxiety.


LSW provided supportive counseling while meeting with parents to address stressors and  identify coping strategies. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
