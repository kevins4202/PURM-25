   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Hunter Morgan
CHOP MRN#: 56918665
DOB:  11/12/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  11/30/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  9:37 AM


Problems: 
Housing 
Custody/Consent


Progress:
SW contacted patient's mom via phone to check in and introduce SW. Mom shared that she and the patient's dad is in the process of moving and have to be out of their apartment by tonight. They have not identified a new home, but in the meantime, mom and dad will be staying at a hotel and their other two children will be with family and friend support so that they can maintain schooling. Mom and dad are both looking to move more towards the Pocono area since the housing is more affordable for them.


SW also checked in on her CYS status and she shared that she is currently with Josh Searle (215-620-0067) who is covering her case for her CYS worker Heather since she is currently out of the office. SW was able to obtain his contact number and will contact Josh later this afternoon to receive an updated on the case.


SW made contact with Josh in the late afternoon and he shared that the patient would be clear to go home with parents come the time of discharge. The only barrier at this moment is securing housing. Josh will keep SW updated on this safety plan as discharge date becomes closer. 


Plan:
SW will continue to provide support to the patient's family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
