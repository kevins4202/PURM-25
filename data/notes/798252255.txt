Progress:  SW and CNS spoke to pt's aunt by phone. She plans to be at bedside for pump teaching tomorrow at 12:00. We asked if she could come in earlier or later to practice feeds; she can be here earlier and will plan to stay into the afternoon. We asked if she can do a 12 hour stay, which she can do this weekend; she will ask PGM if she wants to also come. Informed her that we are planning for potential discharge on 5/9, which she is comfortable with.


SW called CUA worker, Shonse Hawkins (267-275-7634); no answer, left msg.
