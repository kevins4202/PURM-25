Mother, Cheryl Reaves, adopted patient years ago and provides all consents.  Adbour lives at home with mother and three siblings (14 yo brother, 14 yo sister and 16 yo sister).  Abdour refers to his adoptive mother as 'grandmom'.


Abdour reports he completed 9th grade this year and will be entering 10th grade in Fall 2023.


SW reviewed CHOP Visitation Policy with mother, and clarified three siblings names/ages. At this time, mother has only added one limited visitor and is aware that she may add another adult aged limited visitor.  Mother informed that when siblings are present, they should be monitored by mother at all times.
