SW met with Dad and completed a full SW assessment.


Dad shared about Sameer's course and evolving medical needs and his journey to the US. Dad relayed that Sameer was born in Gayana and lived there until October 2022, when Dad was able to obtain an Emergency Passport for him to come to the US for medical care. Per Dad, the hospitals in Gayana are limited in their scope of understanding of medically complex children and he needed to come to the US for more appropriate care. Dad already had dual citizenship in the US and Gayana since 2015. Mom was not granted a Visa in October 2022 and is continuing ongoing efforts to obtain one to come here and be with Sameer. Her next hearing is 5/24. Dad showed SW numerous supporting documents from other hospitals and Senators advocating for Mom to be granted a US Visa. 


Dad continues to work on getting Sameer SSI. 


SW assessed for FMLA, as Dad would qualify. Dad shared that he knows about FMLA, but is unable to utilize it since the family lives paycheck to paycheck and if he took off of work, unpaid, he would be unable to pay for rent and bills for that month.


SW and Dad discussed discharge transportation. SW to approve a Lyft ride home, approved by SW Supervisor Sheronda Ball, due to no other available resources. See separate SW note for approval.
