DOB:  12/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  3/9/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  10:06 AM


Progress:
Mom called SW as she was unsure of how to get in contact with the last person who called her about an appointment. Mom was unsure of the name and when she called the number back, it calls the main CHOP line. Mom wanted her cardiology appointment that is scheduled at St. Christopher's, to possibly be changed closer to her home. SW had no luck tracing back the call so mom shared that she will just wait for a call back as she shared that the person who called will call her back.


Mom also shared that she will be arriving to CHOP via train and plans to arrive around 8pm for her overnight stay. Mom asked for meal vouchers and SW will assist and leave them bedside.
SW encouraged mom to reach out if any additional needs arise. 


Plan: 
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
