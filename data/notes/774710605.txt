Mom, foster mom, and foster dad, are all permitted to stay at bedside 24 hours, but understand that hospital policy should be followed around amount of visitors in the room during visitation, and non-visitation hours. As noted in previous notes, mother's boyfriend (Reginald Blount) must be supervised by foster parents, or CYS staff. Family has been very communicative and have followed this restriction without issue.
