SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE










Progress: SW met with mother at bedside to provide supportive check-in. Mother reports coping well. SW asked regarding financial concerns and discussed possibly applying for rental assistance. Mother declined any financial needs at this time due to ongoing support from the family's church community. Mother discussed church assisting with bringing meals and covering bills. SW expressed appreciation for family's strong support system. SW encouraged mom that SW will continue to be available to assist if anything changes. Mother confirmed understanding and plan to reach out as needed. 
Mother reports being social worker before immigrating to US and asked about how to go about transferring her credentials. SW listened as mother discussed her experiences and hope to continue with SW in the US.  SW expressed being unsure of process and provided mother with contact information for state board of social work as a starting point.


Plan: SW will continue to follow and reassess needs throughout admission to 9 South. Social Work supports will be offered as appropriate throughout hospitalization.
