Hospitalization 


Progress: SW met with Mom at bedside. SW checked in to see how Mom is feeling. Mom reported that today she has mixed emotions. She's a little anxious about the scan that he is receiving but she is also feeling good about getting the process started. Mom reported that she had a issue overnight with the nurse that made her feel uncomfortable. Mom informed SW that she made the medical tem aware of this incident and it was reported to nursing management. Mom also informed SW that Dad is trying to get leave from work in order to be at bedside with her. Mom informed SW that it is a 5hr drive for Dad to get here and she wasn't sure if he was comfortable with taking that drive. SW informed Mom that we have resources that could help Dad get doen here so that her could support her and Benjamin while inpatient. SW encouraged Mom to reach out if she need to talk or need any resources. 


Plan: SW will continue to check in with Mm and provide resources/services when needed.
