Progress:  SW met with mom at bedside to follow up on previous concerns mom had brought to SW/ team attention.  Mom noted that they were adequately resolved at this time, and parents were happy procedure went well today as dad was in a planned wedding and mom was at hospital alone which mom noted wasn't ideal but they appreciated support.  Mom noted that she did have billing issues with medicaid potentially not being retroactive to DOB.  SW noted to clarify with FHCP and admissions and get back to mom.  SW also advised mom to reach out to Billing to put a hold on the bill if it wasn't billed in error and there truly is an issue with coverage dates.  Mom appreciated support.
