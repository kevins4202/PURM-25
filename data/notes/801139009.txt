PATIENT NAME: Girl A-Lashay Stevens
CHOP MRN#: 56912936
DOB:  10/31/2022

Problems: 
Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT members (DO Johnson, LSW Dombrowski) met with mother (Lashay) at bedside to provide ongoing support.  Lashay shared that the family at home had the stomach bug so that's she had to stay away from the hospital in an effort to ensure that Aubree didn't get sick.  Lashay shared joy in the improvements she is seeing in Aubree.  She noted that Aubree's swelling is significantly reduced, she is awake more, and she is also smiling.  She is thankful to see these changes since the trach placement but also recognizes that it is still very hard to have had to move forward with such an intervention.  Lashay never anticipated taking Aubree with a tracheostomy, but is now focused on the training and getting her home as soon and safely as possible.


Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with picu sw.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
