Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW participated in a family meeting this afternoon with Mom, Dad (virtually), an in person Arabic Interpreter, MD Yang, CCRN Trice, and PACT to discuss goals of care.


At this time, both parents want to prioritize keeping Yaseen safe and comfortable here at CHOP. Ultimately, Mom would like Yaseen closer to home, either with fully staffed overnight home nursing or at a local LTCF. Until that is identified, it was agreed upon that Yaseen would remain at CHOP.


Please see MD Yang note for additional details of what was discussed in the meeting.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. SW will follow up with Mom tomorrow about the meeting today. SW will work on registering Yaseen with IDS to open up more potential discharge opportunities for him.


Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
