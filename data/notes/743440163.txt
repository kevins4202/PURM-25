SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver will have coordination between medical team and current CPS providers to support care needs
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress: Covering SW spoke with both foster parent Amanda Schkeeper 215-601-5968 and DCP&P SW Ms. Reyes 732-236-9782 and confirmed Helen was not able to be discharged today as anticipated due to weight loss.  Both Ms. Reyes and Ms. Schkeeper were aware that DCP&P is closed through the holiday (9/3, 9/4, & 9/5).  Baby is anticipated to be ready over this weekend.  Therefore when patient is medically ready, in order for discharge to be in compliance,  Extended hours SW will need to assist medical team with calling DCP&P hotline (1-877-652-2873) and inform the intake worker that a DCP&P worker needs to be present with foster parent to sign for discharge to home (as per previous plan for today).


Plan: Covering SW signed out to medial and extended hours SW team.  


Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
