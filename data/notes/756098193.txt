   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Jordan Neitz
CHOP MRN#: 56911357
DOB:  10/12/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  11/1/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  10:30 PM


Problems:  Custody/consent 


Progress:  SW met with maternal uncle Samuel Neitz at bedside. Per Mr. Neitz his sister, Elizabeth Neitz (302 345 8960) who is the biological mother of Jordan gave permission for him to care for Jordan. This aggreement was made at OSH in Newport News VA. Mr Neitz provided a POA agreement which he stated was signed at hospital in VA prior to discharge. SW explained to Mr. Neitz we need to verify all information and in order to prepare for a safe discharge from this hospital we will need additonal documentation from CPS. Mr Neitz verbalized understanding. 


SW made several unsuccessful attempts to reach CPS in VA for clarification. SW called Bucks County CYS hotline. They stated they received a communication from CPS in Newport News to check the home of Mr. Neitz as a courtesy, but they had not received any follow up information from that office and because Jordan was currently in the hospital in Philadelphia County they would not be doing a home check at this time. They also informed SW any additional documentation as far as consent, safety plan needed should come from CPS in VA. 


SW discussed with leadership and confirmed we need verbal consent and Medical Consent Agreement (MCA) from mom. We also need documentation from CPS it is safe to discharge Jordan home with his uncle. 


It is important to note, moms rights are not terminated and she has the care code to receive updates for his care. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow up with CPS for a plan.
