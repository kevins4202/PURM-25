Megan Parker, CYS case worker
Lindsey Kunkel, SW
Heidi Herrick, Attending
Alyssa Tarzay, FLC
Evelyn Shih, Neurology Attending
Cara Piccoli, Neurology Resident


Team discussed MRI results and confidence that baby will have delays with motor skills; sitting, standing, walking etc. Based on the HIE upon delivery and meningitis infection; the cerebellum was severely injured among other abnormalities warranting genetic work up.  Dad asked appropriate questions and noted processing and repeating things for mom's processing.  Mom was tearful the majority of meeting.  Parents requested after hearing the extent of therapies needed and probable disabilities, that they wanted to hear about baby's other system updates.  SW provided emotional support and parents stayed in meeting room alone for approx. 15 min consoling each other.  SW provided 4 meal vouchers upon request and a journal for continued processing.  Parents appreciated support.  Parents did not return to bedside post meeting however was able to safely return to case worker's car to return to NJ.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
