SOCIAL WORK NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Najiah Lowe
CHOP MRN#: 56962744
DOB:  4/10/2023
TODAY'S DATE:  4/26/2023
TODAY'S TIME: 3:38 PM


Patient and family screened today for Social Work needs.  


Additional Comments: This social worker was paged to see Ashir's mom who expressed feeling the stress and worry of everything going on with her children and her son in the NICU. Both parents were in the NICU at the bedside. Najiah and I went to the office to talk. After some time in the room, I informed her that I would have to address the smell of marijuana in the NICU bedspot, especially since it was clear that it was not coming from her but from Ashir's dad. I spoke to him about changing his clothes or not holding Ashir while there is so much second hand smell residue on his clothes.  
   While in the office Najiah and I called the change center to make sure that Ashir was added to the case for food benefits for the household. 
   I will pass along the concerns


Time Spent: 90 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
