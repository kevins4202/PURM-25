SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  LSW spoke with Roman's mother on the phone to assess needs and provide support. The patient's mother and grandmother were unable to make the G tube training class this morning and asked for it to be rescheduled. LSW assisted the patient's mother in scheduling the training class for Saturday at 10 am. LSW confirmed the time with both mom and grandmom. LSW provided the patient's mother with the Family Learning Center's contact information in case the class needed to be rescheduled again.


LSW spoke with the patient's mother about the importance of completing the training at the learning center and at the bedside. The patient's mother verbalized her understanding. LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address stressors related to Roman's care and training needs. The patient's mother identified childcare for Roman's sister for Saturday so that she would attend the class. 


The patient's mother asked if the nursing interviews could be completed in person because she is unable to access Zoom. LSW reached out to Case Manager, Stephanie Hill-Sandoval, to discuss alternative options for nursing interviews. 


LSW spoke with Roman's grandmother on the phone to emphasize the importance of completing the training at the learning center and at the bedside. The patient's grandmother verbalized her understanding of this and will be working with Roman's mother to complete the identified tasks. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support while Roman is in the NICU.
