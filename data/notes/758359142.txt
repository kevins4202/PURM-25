Progress:  LSW met with the patient's parents at the bedside to assess coping and additional needs. The patient's mother shared that she will be taking a few days away from the hospital in order to take care of herself. The patient's father was present at the bedside and shared that he would be coming to the hospital weekly. The patient's mother received notice that the Medicaid application completed at the OSH was denied. LSW made a referral to FHC to assist the patient's parents in applying for insurance for Leo.


LSW met with the patient's mother later in the day while she held Leo. Kimara has expressed a desire to hold Leo in the past and was excited that she was finally able to do so. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with the patient's mother. Kimara continues to cope as expected given the circumstances.
