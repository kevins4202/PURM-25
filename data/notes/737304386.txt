Progress: PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD STewart - spanish speaking provider) met with mother at bedside to provide ongoing support.  Mother (Jorgeni) shared that she saw Leiliani open her eyes today.  She looks forward to when she can be awake more.  She recognizes that seeing the VAD in place is hard and she has placed a blanket on top so that she doesn't have to constantly visualize.  Jorgeni shared that she is hopeful to share pictures outside Leilani's bedspace so that providers can see her smile.  


Plan: PACT SW will remain available for support in conjunction with cardiology sw.
