Good Morning - 


The above-mentioned patient was recently transferred to my unit. While reviewing the chart I noticed FHCP has been working with the family to assist with insurance. 


I was wondering who this family is assigned to, so I can offer any support FHCP may need with the process. 


Thanks, 
John
