LSW met with the patient's parents several times throughout the week to provide support and assist in adjusting to the NIICU. The parents are coping as expected and the patient's mother expressed increased anxiety surrounding going home for the first time. LSW provided supportive counseling and collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address the anxiety. The patient's mother will reach out to a previous therapist for outside therapeutic support while the patient is hospitalized. 


The parents did not give the patient a legal name at the time of birth. As a result, the parents asked that the LSW reach out to the SDU to request a change to the birth certificate. LSW reached out to Tamika Reaves to request that the patient's legal name be included. The patient's birth certificate will be submitted with the patient's legal name.
