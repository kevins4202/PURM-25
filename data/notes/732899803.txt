Progress:  Mom voluntarily requested that SW make a report to Luzerne County CYS 570-454-9740 based on her concerns with the condition of her apartment.  SW uploaded the auth to release to media manager.  SW called and made the report and the screener noted she would call mom because they doubt they will be able to open the case based on the concern.  They did give mom the resource of the Commission of Economic Opportunity Hazleton office with a Cheryl McLaughlin 570-455-4994 x102 to assist mom with any local housing support.  Mom appreciated support.


Later in the afternoon FOB (who is not involved's) grandmother Kim Fountain 917-562-1922 called the hospital 7 times noting that she was very upset because she felt she was being hung up on specifically when she asked for a supervisor.  Ms. Fountain had questions about the baby's medical care which SW later called mom, received permission for team to speak to Ms. Fountain and provide her medical updates.  Mom noted that she has been frustrated and speaking to MS. Fountain about her confusion with the baby's hospitalization.  SW arranged with mom to meet with medical team tomorrow to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Ms. Fountain also noted that she felt adequately informed at this time.
