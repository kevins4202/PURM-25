Progress:  LSW spoke with Roman's grandmother and asked for the patient's mother to give LSW a call back.


LSW spoke with Roman's mother. She identified the grandmother as the second learner and Roman's aunt, Journey Wyche, as the watcher. Roman's mother would like for the grandmother (Latiya Moore) to have the second parent badge. 


LSW spoke with nursing leadership to request approval for the second parent badge to be given to the grandmother. Approval was provided. 


LSW called and spoke with Roman's grandmother to inform her that approval was given for her to receive a parent badge. 


On 1/6/22 Latiya Moore can visit before normal visiting hours begin prior to her receiving the parent badge as the patient is having surgery at 7:20 am.
