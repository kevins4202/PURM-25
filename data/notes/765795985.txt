Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  LSW made outreach to the patient's mother via phone.  LSW was unable to leave a voicemail so sent a message to Roman's mother asking for a call back and requested that she call the medical team to provide consent for the bronchoscopy scheduled for tomorrow. LSW met with Roman's maternal grandmother at the bedside on 12/14 and asked that she have the patient's mother call the hospital.




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and make outreach to Roman's mother.




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
