Progress:  LSW spoke with Roman's mother on the phone to assess coping and provide emotional support. Patient's mother continues to cope appropriately given the circumstances per LSW's assessment. LSW provided the patient's mother with community resources to address stressors. Patient's mother asked to speak with the medical team to discuss questions she has about Roman's extubation. 


LSW facilitated a phone meeting with the patient's mother and Dr. William Corder. Roman's mother asked appropriate questions and demonstrated an understanding of the information shared. Roman's grandmother joined the conversation and stated that she would like to be present for Roman's extubation on Tuesday to provide support. Dr. Corder informed the patient's mother and grandmother that the plan is to trial extubation next Tuesday and assured the family that if that was a change the family would be made aware.
