Additional comments:  
SW approved two meal vouchers a day for Mom and Dad this weekend, as they participate in discharge education and planning at the bedside. The family has no financial resources. Meal vouchers will be delivered to the bedside.


SW also approved a Lyft ride from 30th Street Station to CHOP today, and a Lyft ride from CHOP to 30th Street Station on 10/2 for discharge. SW and CFF will collaborate to support the family with locating their Lyft today, as CFF cannot send ride information in Haitian Creole. 


Family is aware of all approvals.
