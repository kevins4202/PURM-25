   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Tiesha Reddy
CHOP MRN#: 56917884
DOB:  11/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  12/9/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  11:24 AM


Problems: 
Custody/consent 


Progress: 
SW contacted DHS worker Kelli Seibert to receive an update on who will have custody of the patient in order for the patient to go home. Kelli shared that aunt, Latifah Reddy, is still being explored as the point person. There has to be a home assessment completed and the aunt needed updated clearance, which is in the process now. SW asked if aunt can begin to come in for teaching and Kelli said yes. SW also asked to identify a second caregiver for the patient who can have teaching and Kelli said that maternal grandmother, Tamika Reddy, would be ok to continue with teaching for discharge.


Kelli also shared that DHS nursing has to consult to the home but in order to get that started/completed, they will need the latest progress note. SW obtained DHS Nurse contact, Bernadette Goodman (215-630-3960), and SW made contact with her. She provided SW with her email to provide the progress note. SW sent over the note.


Plan:
SW will continue to provide support to the patient and family in order to continue with discharge planning. 
SW will continue to follow up with DHS
