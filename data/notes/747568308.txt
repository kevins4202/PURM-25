Plan: 


SW met with Mom to check in and offer on going support. Mom shared that the patient is doing well, and may be discharged on Sunday. Mom shared that she spoke with the DHS worker, Gabby, and it was asked if the CHOP main entrance could be a drop off/pick up point for the patients sibling, as Dad currently has partial custody of the patient, and has visitation on the weekends. SW spoke with CHOP security and it was agreed that Mom could receive assistance with this pick up/drop off, and Mom will alert the front desk security officer, whom will provide support. 


SW spoke with Mom and the DHS case worker Gabby, and it was confirmed that Mom currently lives with her sister, whom is Mom's main source of support, and approved by DHS. Gabby stated that Mom's sister is the main support in the family's safety plan, and there are no current concerns with discharging the patient home to Mom and Mom's sister. 


SW provided Mom with additional support and resources as necessary. 


SW will continue to check in and provide on going support.
