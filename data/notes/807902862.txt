PATIENT NAME: Boyb-Imonie Denise Ware
CHOP MRN#: 56839432
DOB:  5/8/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  6/16/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  4:34 PM


Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: Multiple efforts have been made by SW and others to contact mother. SW met with grandmother (Latiya) throughout the week for support. Great-grandmother (Denise) was also bedside to visit patient this week. Grandmother reports that they have not heard from Mom in over a week and may file a missing persons report. Grandmother reports they are worried because mom has her 2 yr old daughter Dakota with her. Grandmother reports not knowing exactly where they are but believes they are staying with patient and Dakota's father.  Grandmother provided address of patient's father to CUA worker. 


CUA Worker Baby Rucker reported that she has also made several attempts to contact mom through unannounced visits to father's home, phone calls and texts in order to obtain consent for patient's transfer to Childway next week. She has been unsuccessful.  Ms. Rucker stated that case will hopefully be moved to the courts so that the courts can provide consent for transfer. CUA informed that we may lose the bed at Childway if consent is not obtained by next week. 


Plan: SW continues to follow and will continue to assess for psychosocial needs and provide supportive counseling.
