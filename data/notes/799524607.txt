Progress: 
LSW met with mom and Savannah at bedside. Mom and Savannah noted to LSW that Savannah was sitting up without any respiratory support. Savannah and mom reflected on stressors of last week and fear of needing reintubation. Savannah shared not wanting to "go back to the dark place." Savannah shared that when she was intubated there was a time when she couldn't communicate or move but was awake. Mom shared feeling alone in her advocacy last week when Savannah worsened overnight. Family has shared this with the team and LSW validated how scary this must have been and offered support and space for Savannah and mom to process. Mom said she feels well supported overall by the medical and psychosocial teams. Mom described feeling relieved that Savannah has been doing better and they were able to enjoy time together last night. 


Savannah and mom discussed difficulties of their family being separated and missing milestone events for Savannah's brother. Family has been staying in touch. Mom expressed appreciation for ongoing SW support.
