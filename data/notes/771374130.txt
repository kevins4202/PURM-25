SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver will have coordination between medical team and current CPS providers to support care needs
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  SW spoke to CYS worker, Olivia Jones (717-606-5206) to inform her pt has transferred and this SW will be covering.
She confirmed the following:
- CYS had custody and provides consents. (She can be contacted during the day or On Call CYS after hours and weekends  717-293-7724)
- Pt's mother is allowed to visit unrestricted and unsupervised. 
- Current discharge plan is to MGM, but will revisit closer to discharge when medical needs are known.


SW inquired about insurance; worker reports that a different dept manages insurance, but SW asked her to verify that pt has been added so discharge needs can be addressed without delay. 




Plan: Will meet mom at bedside when she returns. Will keep CYS worker updated.




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
