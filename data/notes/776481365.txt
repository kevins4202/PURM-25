PATIENT NAME: Babyboy Jennifer Schultz
CHOP MRN#: 56876127
DOB:  8/4/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  2/2/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  8:41 PM


Problems: 
Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, CRNP Nelson, RN Coordinator LaRagione) met with mother (Jen) at bedside to provide ongoing support.  Jen shared what a difficult night Colton had requiring a sepsis rule out.  She decided to stay overnight to be able to watch him.  She is feeling that he is resting well this morning and appears comfortable which she is thankful for.  Jen continues to balance all of Colton's needs here at the hospital as well as her son Julian's at home.  She is also navigating work issues and a potential cut of hours which is an understandable stressor for her. 


Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with nicu sw.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
