Progress: Covering SW received the follow message from the RN to pass along to the PICU SW's : 


Hi, I believe you are covering Emily. Yari went to the PICU and I spoke with both her mom and her sister over the phone about the plan. Is it possible to pass along to the SW in the PICU her sister's information because it is not listed in the facesheet. She lives in CT so cannot come to the hospital, but is very close with mom and speaks very good english and helps her understand a lot. Her name is Betzaida "Betsy" Llanes and her phone number is 860-839-8420. I worry that if Yari continues to do poorly they will need to have a serious meeting with mom and it would be very beneficial for her sister to attend virtually. 




This writer is also in receipt of Emily Baumley's throuough sign out sign out from 4/19/2023. SW will relay that information to the floor SW who will be covering Yaribeth in the PICU.






Plan: SW will continue to offer and provide inpatient SW support to the pt and family.
