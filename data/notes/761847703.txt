SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver will have coordination between medical team and current CPS providers to support care needs
Outcome: Not Met this Shift







Progress:  SW spoke with DCPP worker, Megan Parker (609-947-4656). She is aware that facility has a bed available and she has already signed their admission paperwork. SW inquired if she has met with mom recently; she reports she met with her in the jail on 11/18 and mom is aware pt will be transferred to a facility. She offered to bring written documentation of pt's care to mom, but she is unable to assist mom with calling us for an update. (She reports that she has been able to speak to mom through MGM and we could try that). She reports that she has custody of pt and can sign needed paperwork.


SW called Atlantic Cty Correctional Facility (Warden Kelly (609-909-7440) who transferred me to the shift supervisor. He took mom's information and the unit phone # and offered to have mom call back. SW informed team.




Plan: Will assist with communication with pt's mother and transfer to facility. 




Time Spent: 90 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
