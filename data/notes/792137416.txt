Additional Comments: 


SW received Epic chat message from nursing, stating that father is requesting a change to be made to the previous exception which allowed MGM to be present at bedside when she brought mother to visit Elmer.   Per nursing, father asking if MGM can be changed to an aunt.  


SW collaboration with Charge RN for case discussion.  It is agreed that the exception that was made cannot be changed, however father can change one of his two limited visitors per CHOP Visitation policy every two weeks.  Father has not made any changes since admission.


SW met with PGF at bedside for supportive check in; PGF is amenable and Elmer is sleeping.


PGF is aware of father's inquiry.  SW explained that there can not be any changes made to the exception at this time, however father can make a change with two identified limited visitors (PGF or MGF).  PGF discussed the schedule of grandfathers and father at bedside, and stated father will most likely not make any changes at this time.  SW expressed understanding. 


PGF has no expressed barriers to self care at this time, although verbalizing his preference for his own meals at home.  SW reminded PGF that meals can be brought in from home and stored in Family/unit refrigerator in family lounge.
