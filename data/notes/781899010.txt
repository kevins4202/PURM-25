SW met with guardian Elizabeth Telada to introduce CICU SW and complete psychosocial assessment.
Per Elizabeth and documentation in chart, Elizabeth has full guardianship of the pt and is permitted to provide consents for all medical needs. Elizabeth reports she is filing for full custody and plans to move forward with adoption. Elizabeth states that case has been closed with Bradford County Children & Youth, though they have been a helpful resource in moving forward with filing for custody. SW left voicemail for office to confirm status. 
Addendum: SW received return call from Bradford County to confirm that case has been closed and there is no active Children & Youth involvement.
SW provided copy of the cardiac family resource guide and reviewed available resources and supports. Elizabeth has checked into local RMH. Family resides in Canton, PA.  
SW will continue to follow and provide support.
