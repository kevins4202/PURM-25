Progress:
SW was made aware by mom that her room for RMH has to be renewed. SW called RMH to extend the stay and it will not need to be renewed until May of 2023.


SW later called RMH SW Department to inquire about patient's needing a long term stay that may extend the 365 day limit. Liz Thul, Tom Laws, and Sari Sosnick shared that they are happy to help the family with their extended stay and we will all collaborate to assist the family. SW inquired whether the family is able to utilize the RMH house as their primary address and it was confirmed that they are allowed. Sari will email SW a "Length of Stay" letter that will confirm that the family is staying at RMH, which can also be used for SSI and any additional benefits the family may need. 
Community Legal Services (215-981-3700) had been recommended by the RMH SW. This agency will be able to collaborate with SW and assist the family with SSI, Medicaid, and immigration status.


For long term planning, SW as well as RMH SW will assist family with applying for the affordable housing lottery voucher if family is allowed and open to permanently relocating to the area. SW will have a conversation with the family in regards to this. 




Plan: 
SW will contact Community Legal Services.
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family.
