Progress:  SW received a phone call from mother today.  SW returned the phone call with Psychology on the phone.  Mom noted she was able to have her tooth pulled and also had a job interview today however they were too busy and she was going to follow up again tomorrow.  Mom noted she called to inquire if SW had heard from Good Counsel Homes.  SW noted that they did return the call to SW however SW was unclear of mom's ability to communicate with SW appropriately at that time.  Mom noted that Good Counsel never called her directly as SW was informed.  SW advised mom to reach out to Good Counsel herself at this time.  SW attempted to address previous conflict between mom and SW/ appropriate use of communication however mom noted she had another call and conversation ended.
