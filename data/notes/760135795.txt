Farrah made me aware that she got a call that Onyx would likely be discharged tonight. She needed assistance with a car seat and also diapers, clothes, etc. A car seat was ordered, per Katy K. ( SW on 9 South). I brought some things from SDU and NICU that she could bring home for him. The nurse was asked to gather what she could send home for diapers,etc. 
    Farrah asked a family member to drive down from Allentown to help with get ting them home.
