Progress: 
SW called patient's mom to check in and to see how she was doing. Mom shared she is doing well and has no immediate needs at the moment. She is just waiting to see when Sydney will be able to go home. SW also inquired about CYS case to see if it was closed or still open. Mom shared she did not receive any letter that it was closed so she is under the impression that it is still open. SW was in contact with previous worker, Mr. Sirleaf, who shared the case was closed so SW obtained new workers contact number from mom (Mr. Michael 267-581-7173).
