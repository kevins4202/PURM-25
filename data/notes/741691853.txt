Progress:


SW spoke with DCPP caseworker Lisa regarding discharge planning for Aiden. Lisa shared that pt's mother (Alexis) will be discharged from inpatient treatment next week. Initial plans discussed were Alexis moving into a program in north Jersey for mothers in recovery, however Alexis would have extremely limited support in caring for Aiden and would be far from family. DCPP and family in support of Alexis returning home with maternal great-grandmother (MGGM) in Cape May, NJ. MGGM has a seasonal job over the summer that ends 9/5 then is available full-time for support.
