   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Jocelynn A Blake
CHOP MRN#: 56411033
DOB:  6/23/2019
TODAY'S DATE:  2/3/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  9:17 AM


Problems: 
Hospitalization, Diagnosis, Coping with illness/disability and Treatment 


Progress: Ongoing. SW met with the MGM primarily yesterday afternoon following a bedside meeting SW attended that the mother and MGM had with the Attending, Dr. Kaur, that appeared to be very productive in terms of agreeing with a plan of care going forward. SW strongly encouraged the MGM to take regular breaks and she agreed that she needs to get away at times from the room. SW met with the MGM after she took the break and she admitted that she felt better. This SW also feels as though the mother and MGM have slightly different approaches with the patient supportively and that can attribute at times to the type of support and encouragement she needs from the family when both the mother and MGM are staying here full-time with the patient but do not live together.


Plan: SW will check-in again with the family to closely monitor how they are coping and be available to offer supportive counseling. SW will meet with the mother today for a discussion about a reply she made about a concern on the Family Well Being Questionnaire. SW has also approved meal vouchers for both mother and MGM if necessary through 2/5/23 if the patient is still hospitalized.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
