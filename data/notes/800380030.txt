Progress:  LSW provided emotional support following medical rounds. The patient's parents had questions about Bentley's care plan and prognosis. Dr. Munson and LSW met with the patient's parents away from the bedside to provide a space to ask questions. Dr. Munson provided the parents with an overview of Bentley's respiratory needs and lung development. Parents were made aware that the patient is still at risk of developing NEC and highlighted the importance of starting feeds when the patient is ready. Dr. Munson explained that Bentley is at risk of having developmental delays given his prematurity. It is unknown at this time what that might look like for Bentley and will all depend on his hospital course. The patient's parents asked thoughtful and appropriate questions demonstrating their understanding of Bentley's care plan. 


LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to identify ways she can bond with Bentley even when he cannot be held. 


LSW provided emotional support to the parents during Bentley's reintubation following an unplanned extubation. The patient's parents were appropriately tearful. 


Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
