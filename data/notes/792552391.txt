Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: Writer met with parents for support. Vienna was crying/upset during half of the conversation. Mother was laying in bed with Vienna. Parents reported they applied for RMH. Parents spoke about the challenges of being in the hospital. We discussed some of the ups and downs since surgery and how each day is different. Parents stated they have family/friends who have been supportive and have dropped off clothes and stuff. Writer encouraged parents to engage in some self care each day. Father reports he goes downstairs to get food and might plan to go to a local drugstore to pick up bottles for Noelle (3.5 month old sister). Writer asked if the bedside RN can put in a lactation consult as parents have questions about finding the best bottle for Noelle. Father had some questions about FMLA. Writer encouraged him to speak to his employer to obtain the paperwork.  


Plan: Writer will continue meeting with mother and father to assess for psychosocial needs and provide supportive counseling.


Time Spent: 60 minutes
