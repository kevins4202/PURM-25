Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW received an email from Yaseen's 1:1 school RN, Denise Bateson (dbateson@mciu.org). RN relayed that she has been trying to get in touch with Mom, but has been unable to reach her. RN inquired if Yaseen was discharged and coming back to school or if he remains inpatient. 


SW responded that Yaseen remains inpatient and is not medically cleared at this time. 




Plan: SW will continue to follow. Yaseen is not medically cleared for discharge and his discharge plan is unknown at this time, due to his acute overnight respiratory needs and no nursing staffed in the home. Mom is interested in exploring a facility. We are having a meeting with the family today at 1pm to discuss potentially pursuing a tracheostomy for Yaseen.


Time Spent: 15 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
