Jaylee Severino-Kee is a 15 month old female with no past medical history, was transferred from Vorhees ED to CHOP ED due to URI with metabolic acidosis. 


Pt presented to an OSH on Monday (Inspira) and was noted to be rhinovirus positive and discharged.  Pt represented the next day to Virtua and was transferred to CHOP and placed into an ED room. Pt was then transferred from a room to the trauma bay due to changes on monitor, cap refill greater than 3 seconds, extremities cool to the touch and changes in mental status. SW met mom and dad in the trauma bay and provided ongoing emotional support. Family very receptive to SW support. SW followed pt to the CICU. While on the CICU pt arrested, required CPR, was intubated, and was placed on ECMO. Mother is appropriately very tearful and of note she is 7 weeks pregnant. 




SW signed out to CICU SW for ongoing support
