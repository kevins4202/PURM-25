Presenting Problem/Reason for Referral:  Suspected Ingestion


Mason Stephens is a 3yr old male who presented to the CHOP ED from OSH ED (Cooper ED) on 9/11/22 due to respiratory failure and requiring intubation. During patient's CHOP admission, his toxicology work up was positive for illicit substances and the Child Protection Team was consulted to further assess and evaluate. The patient was initially admitted to PICU and he has since been transferred to the General Pediatric Service for further medical management.



Mother was present at patient bedside and provided admission history to the CPT (SW, rotating medical student, Fellow-Dr. Miller, and Attending-Dr. Fortin). Mother stated that she first noticed that something was wrong with patient on Sunday (9/14/22) at approximately 5PM. Mother stated that patient and his siblings (sister-age 8 and brother-age 1) were all in her bedroom and she stated that patient ate something, drank juice, and then took a nap on her. Mother stated that patiently normally naps and it was not unusual for him to take a nap. Mother stated that while patient was sleeping on her chest, she heard him gasping and he was turning blue. Mother then called 911 and patient was transported to OSH ED.



Per chart review: Ultimately, on 9/14, his drug screens were positive for xylazine (fentanyl metabolite commonly found in street fentanyl), methylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), and nicotine metabolites (also positive for ketamine metabolites, but received ketamine for intubation at referring hospital). Toxicology and Poison Control were consulted. SW was consulted and a report to NJ Child Protective Services was made (see separate SW documentation). 



CPT asked Mother if she knows how the ingestion could have occurred and Mother said no. Mother denies that anyone in her household has any drug or alcohol issues. Mother denies that she has any medications in her home.



Patient currently resides at home with Mother, sister (age 8), brother (age 1), and brother's paternal aunt. Mother stated that Father was released from prison in July and she stated that he is not active in patient's life. Mother does report a previous history with Child Protective Services. Mother stated that DCPP was involved one year ago due to patient breaking his leg while in Father's care. Mother stated that she does not have a criminal history. Mother stated that Father has a criminal history and he was recently incarcerated and released in July. Mother stated that Father has gun and drug charges. Mother denies any history of drug or alcohol abuse, mental health issues or domestic violence in the home. Mother did report that Father has recently threatened her due to issues around him owing child support. Mother is unemployed and Father's employment status is unknown at this time. Patient does not attend daycare and does not have any babysitters.
