SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  Met with pt's mother at bedside. Followed up on Colette Louise application; mom has not completed the request; SW encouraged her to complete it this week.  We discussed finding a PMD for pt; mom has a recommendation from a friend that she will look into. Discussed formula for discharge; pt is registered for WIC. Mom will make an appt closer to discharge. We discussed purchasing a can to last until the WIC appt. Mom has some at home and will let SW know what kind it is, to see if it can be used while awaiting her WIC appt. Pt is on Similac Neosure, which will require a prescription form. SW will fax WIC form closer to discharge. SW offered support as we plan for discharge.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
