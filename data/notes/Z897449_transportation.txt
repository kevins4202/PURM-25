SW discussed that an October mortgage statement is needed for her ODF application. Mom agreed to send to PICU SW who applied on behalf of the family. Mom is hopeful they will be approved. 


Mom asked about whether Fred's Footsteps would consider the family for additional funding since they received funding from them many years ago. SW offered to look into this. 


Mom shared that they had SSI for Jenna when she was younger, but no longer get it, due to receiving letters that they owe money back to SSI that they were given. Mom expressed that this was more stressful than beneficial to the family. Mom also denied having MLTSS because they do not qualify.


Mom is hopeful that Jenna can be discharged soon after this long admission.


Mom asked about home nursing updates. SW will relay to CM. 


Discharge transportation will be through ModivCare if Jenna is discharged during the week. If she is discharged on the weekend, ambulance transport will be needed since ModivCare does not provide rides on the weekends. SW will call in the discharge ride on the day of discharge. Mom discussed ongoing barriers with transportation and that SW Jones has been supportive in helping her look into it, although there is no solution.
