Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW facilitated a video call between Yaseen and his mother this morning. Mom was so happy and tearful during the call to see Yaseen for the first time since her surgery.  Yaseen was asleep, so the video call was brief. Mom asked if we could do another video all when he is awake, SW agreed.


SW will check in with when Yaseen is awake to do another video call with his mother.


Addendum 3:30pm: SW spoke with Mom over the phone, along with RN Daniella. SW received formal telephone consent from Mom to take and send her pictures of Yaseen while she is unable to come to the hospital recovering from her surgery. Mom consented. SW uploaded the consent form to the pt's EMR. 


SW sent Mom a photo of Yaseen is his wheelchair today via MyCHOP.


Addendum 4:30pm: SW facilitated another video call with Mom and Yaseen while he was awake. Yaseen smiled several times throughout the call and appeared very happy to see and hear his mother's voice. Yaseen's sister and dog Oreo joined the call, as well, which also made Yaseen smile. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow. SW will continue to facilitate video calls with Yaseen's mother while she is recovering from her surgery and unable to be here.
