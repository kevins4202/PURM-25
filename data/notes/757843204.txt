Baby Boy "Leo" is a 4 week old baby who presented to CHOP with bacteremia, meningitis and pneumoperitoneum.  PACT is consulted for longitudinal and medical decision making support.  PACT met with mother (Kimara) at bedside to introduce the role of PACT, assess needs and provide support.  Father (Victor) called during our discussion and is aware that when he is at bedside our team will also come by to introduce our services to him.  Kimara shared how challenging the past four weeks has been.  She expressed that she thinks a lot about Leo's quality of life, his comfort, and what his life will be like going forward.  Kimara shared that she and Victor have thought differently about possible treatment paths going forward in the prior days but right now she is trying to focus on being hopeful and prayerful.  She has heard from the medical teams concerns about Leo's brain injury and understands this information.   Kimara also holds hope that Leo can be an active, happy child.  


Kimara is currently at bedside but recognizes that she may need a break from bedside.  She expects that Victor might be able to visit today or tomorrow.  She has support from her extended family many of whom are in NJ.
