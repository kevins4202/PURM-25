Progress: Spina Bifida Social Worker spoke with mom by phone after receiving email message about SSI/home care. Mom stated that Sydney remains inpatient and now has a gastronomy tube. She will have another surgery next week. Mom reported frustration with the prolonged admission and is hopeful that Sydney will be able to be discharged soon. Mom continues to take the train to and from CHOP since they do not have a vehicle. Mom asked about being a paid caregiver for Sidney since she would prefer not to send her to medical daycare. Discussed that PA does not typically pay parents to care for their children under the age of 18. Mom intends to call Keystone for a case manager and she can discuss this further with her case manager.  


Mom stated that she spoke with Keystone First and they are going to assist her with the SSI application. Mom is asking for a list of Sydney's specialists to provide to them and SW will assist mom with the specialists that Sydney has seen at CHOP.
