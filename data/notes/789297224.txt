SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: RELATIONSHIPS/BEHAVIOR
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver visitation concerns will be addressed
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  Social worker received a call from CHOP security officer Plummer regarding an altercation between parents that occurred in the parking garage. Father brought to the CHOP ED for evaluation. Per CHOP Security's request, a visitation schedule must be implemented wherein parents may not visit at the same time until further assessment can be completed. 


Social worker attempted to reach parents by phone to discuss a visitation schedule, however parents did not answer and mother was not at bedside. Social worker placed a visitor restriction in the chart with instructions for extended hours social work to be contacted when parents arrive to discuss a visitation schedule. 


Given financial and transportation barriers, mother, Martha Toukolehto, may visit overnight tonight. A visitation schedule must be implemented with parents once social work is able to discuss with both parents. 


Extended hours social work, charge nurse, bedside nurse and security notified of the plan above. 




Plan: Social work will continue to follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
