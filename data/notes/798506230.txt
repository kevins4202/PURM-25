Progress:  SW met with pt's aunt at bedside; she had just completed pump teaching with CHHC. PGM was not able to be present, but she plans to bring her during the 12 hour stay this wknd for nursing to teach and PGM for practice. In further consideration, aunt is now interested in shift nursing to care for pt while she works, so as not to overwhelm PGM with caring for pt and twin. SW explained that this would likely not be in place by discharge, but aunt will take off of work if PGM is not comfortable caring for pt, so that is fine.


SW confirmed that formula will be provided by CHHC and informed aunt.


SW spoke to CUA worker, Shonse Hawkins (267-275-7634). Provided medical update and tentative plan for discharge next week; she will continue to work with family and situation must be approved before discharge.






Plan: CUA must approve discharge plan - will follow up with worker on Monday after caregiver stay this wknd.




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
