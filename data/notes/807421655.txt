Yaribeth is a 13 yo girl with past medical history significant for chromosomal deletion syndrome, semilobar holoprosencephaly, neurologic impairment, CP and severe scoliosis who presented with acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to respiratory infection.  Family meeting held yesterday regarding possible surgical plan including tracheostomy, halo placement and scoliosis surgery.  PACT was consulted in the setting for longitudinal and medical decision making support.  PACT Members (MD Mejia, LSW Dombrowski) met with mother (Yolanda) using Spanish video interpreter on PICU ipad to introduce the role, assess needs and provide support.  Yolanda was appropriately tearful in thinking about this hospital admission and how different her daughter's needs on. She shared her great love and connection to her daughter as well as her great hope and faith that Yaribeth can get back to her happy baseline where she is able to participate in school.  Yolanda shared that she has heard about the multi-step surgical plan.  She is appropriately worried and clearly understands the risks and that it may not help Yaribeth in the way everyone hopes.  She also knows that this will be a lengthy hospitalization.  Yolanda worries how Yaribeth will tolerate the halo specifically.  She realizes that it will likely cause her daughter discomfort but has also heard that there will be medication available to help Yaribeth be more comfortable.  Yolanda also shared her daughter's ongoing strength and her own faith in God that she will do well.  Yolanda expressed even with her hope, she also realizes that "everything is God's plan" and she will need to accept that. Yoland has already talked to her sister and has decided to pursue the surgical path offered.  


Yaribeth lives at home with her mother in Trenton.  Yoland has been working to find new housing as their have been issues with mice in her home.  Yolanda shared that she has her own health history that makes it hard for her to be a physical caregiver - she suffered a heart attack, stroke and has significant vision loss.  She relies on others for rides home and to her own medical appointments.  Yolanda is Christian and finds great strength in her faith.  Yoland has a sister in CT but she is over 4 hours away.  Her other family members are in Puerto Rico.
