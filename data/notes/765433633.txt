She also shared that parents can provide medical consent since their rights have not been terminated. This would include any invasive care, xrays, and/or surgeries. It had been recommended that the patient recieves the Synagis RSV immunization. Kelli shared that if this specific immunization is not routine, she said to defer the decision to the parents. If parents deny, Kelli would like to know.
