Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient will have adequate insurance coverage to obtain necessary medical care
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  Covering social worker spoke with Schuylkill County CYS worker Megan Kromer (570-628-1050) to provide update. CYS worker noted that CYS would be amenable to patient being transferred to a hospital closer to the foster parents' in Lancaster County, however noted that per the medical team, this likely would not be approved by insurance and there could be additional barriers related to the patient's medical needs upon discharge. Social worker relayed that patient currently has Geisinger Health Plan PA Medical Assistance. Social worker noted that the patient's PA Medical Assistance managed care plan will need to be changed to one of the 5 managed care plans available in Lancaster County to assist with discharge planning. CYS worker plans to follow up to begin this process in her office. No other immediate social work needs identified. 




Plan: Covering social worker will remain available.
