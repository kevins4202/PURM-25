Additional Comments: 
SW met with mother and patient at bedside to provide emotional support, discuss unit based social work roles, introductions, reflective listening, and assessment of needs since transferring units. Mother appeared receptive to the afternoon visit, presenting in a clear mind state and showing signs of an appropriate affect. Mother reports to be familiar with the hospital as this has been an extended hospitalization. Mother continues to have a clear understanding of the care plan, denying concerns at this time.  Presently, mother has opted to alternate between remaining at bedside and returning to her Atlantic City home, as she has a older child at home.
