Patient's Name:  Baby Girl A Marie Marseille-Rosalva 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2022 
MRN:  56877941


Progress: SW reviewed ED SW note from the weekend and noted that both parents left the bedside over the weekend.


SW called DCPP caseworker Eirini Otaegui (desk: 609-626-3288; work cell: 609-915-7955). SW updated DCPP about the family's plans to move to Boston. 


SW called Dad with a Haitian Creole interpreter (ID# 257386) to follow up regarding progress with their move to Boston. SW LVM requesting a call back.


Addendum 1:45pm: SW attempted to contact Dad again with a Haitian Creole Interpreter. SW LVM requesting a call back. 


SW called DCPP and updated her on Dad's conversation with MD. Per MD, Dad stated they will leave for Boston on Wednesday and requested ambulance transport home for the baby on Saturday. SW relayed SW's increasing concerns. DCPP agreed to go out to the home and talk with the family.


SW later received a call from Lara D'Anna (New Beginnings Nurse, 609-309-2222). Lara reports that Dad called her requesting they provide him with money for transportation to pick up the baby from the hospital tomorrow. Lara also reports that Dad stated that his plan when he arrives in Boston is to go to a hospital in Boston and a social worker will find him a home. Lara expressed ongoing concerns about this plan. 


Addendum 4pm: DCPP added SW to a call with her and the family. Dad discussed that his plan is to go to Boston on Wednesday and will meet up with his friend there who knows a social worker who can help them find housing. Dad agreed to provide SW with the address as soon as he has it. Dad discussed that he plans to return on Friday. SW discussed that Dad should come to CHOP upon his return so we can discuss discharge planning. 


SW and DCPP spoke after the call about next steps. DCPP requested that SW call her when Dad provides the address, or if Dad does not return like he plans on Friday (609-517-9644- this is DCPP personal cell phone). DCPP plans to transfer the case to Boston once the family moves to ensure social support transitions there.


Plan: Esther was to be discharged on 10/2, but remains admitted after SW learned that the family is moving to Boston to ensure a safe discharge plan is in place. Family plans to go to Boston on Wednesday and return on Friday with a home in place. SW will continue to follow.
