Progress: PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Musheno) met with mother at bedside using video spanish interpreter to introduce the role of PACT, assess needs and provide support.  Mother (Jorgeni) expressed that she knows how sick her daughter is and she is thankful that today is stable.  It has been hard and scary to see how sick Leilani has gotten.  Jorgeni shared that she feels the strength of her daughter and hopes that she can improve.  She shared her faith in God and belief that "everything happens for a reason".  She believes that if this is happening it's because there is something good to come later.
