TODAY'S TIME:  10:26 AM


Problems: 
Custody/consent 


Progress:
SW called Kelli Seibert (267-441-6687), and her phone went to voicemail and a voice message has not been set up yet. SW called DHS Informations to receive the supervisors number. SW was able to obtain Julian Johnston's (215-807-9668) contact. SW called Julian and phone also went straight to voicemail and no voice message has been set up yet.
SW provided DHS Informations with best contact information so that either Kelli or Julian can return the calls.


Kelli called SW back at 10:59am and informed SW that she has still been trying to get in contact with dad in order to complete the patient's safety plan for discharge. Kelli shared she has called numerous times and has not heard back from dad. In order for patient to be released to dad, his home will have to be inspected and DHS will have to state if it is safe or not. SW inquired about grandmom who has been present and Kelli shared that dad would have to be ruled out first before exploring grandmom as an option. Kelli said she may have an answer this Friday 12/9/2022.


SW attempted to follow up to call dad in regards to patient's discharge plan and dad's phone cannot receive calls at this time. 


Plan:
Continue to follow up to obtain information in regards to custody for discharge.
