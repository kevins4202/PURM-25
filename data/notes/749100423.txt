   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Lisa McPherson
CHOP MRN#: 56895816
DOB:  5/26/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  9/30/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  2:45 PM


Problems: 
Transportation, discharge planning and follow-up care.


Progress: Ongoing. SW was able to reach the mother by phone to discuss the plan for discharge education. The mother was given a few options to either stay overnight Monday or Tuesday night, so, she opted to plan with the father so she reported that they will plan to come in early Tuesday morning in order to arrive on the Unit by 9am so that they can prepare to stay throughout the day and hopefully go home with the patient Tuesday. SSW also had a discussion about applying for WIC at her local WIC Office. Mother reported that she has the number, which I was prepared to give to her, and, she noted that she intends to call for an appointment. SW also encouraged the mother to complete the transportation application ASAP so that she can benefit from riding to CHOP from a distance rather than having to drive in the typical traffic.


Plan: SW will follow closely for continued supportive needs.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
