Progress: SW informed by Mom and IDS that the intake interview scheduled for 6/15 was canceled due to Mom not selecting a Supports Coordination Agency in advance and Mom wanting this SW to attend the meeting. 


SW asked for IDS to connect with Mom about the SC agencies to provide guidance, as Mom is not familiar with what they are. IDS stated they are unable to assist families with selecting an SC. IDS sent SW the list of agencies. SW will go over them with Mom. 


SW texted Mom asking what time she can talk to SW today. SW will assist Mom with selecting an SC and reschedule the intake meeting together.


Plan: SW will continue to follow.
