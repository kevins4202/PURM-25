Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaribeth Pabon 
Date of Birth:  1/22/2010 
MRN:  56963221


Progress: SW met with Mom at the bedside this afternoon. Mom shared about her Mother's Day with Yari and the wonderful day they shared together.


Mom asked SW questions about the family meeting tomorrow. SW encouraged Mom to think about questions she may have for the doctor's tomorrow. 


SW shared that Voorhees is coming to see Yari tomorrow to do an assessment and see if she could be a good fit for their LTCF. Mom asked a lot of questions about the LTCF. Mom's primary concern is that when she wants to take Yari home, they will not let her. SW discussed this concern with Mom, but also encouraged her to share this with Voorhees to hear directly from them. At this time, Mom continues to strongly consider LTCF for Yari while Mom gets better and finds a better home for them. Mom continues to struggle with the idea of being away from Yari and fears that the LTCF will not let Yari go home. 


SW assessed for concrete resource need. Mom does not need any additional resources at this time.


Mom will be at the hospital Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning this week. She will return on Saturday after her appointments. Mom's sister, Ada, will return to NJ on June 9th. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow. Family meeting planned for tomorrow to discuss Yari's plan of care.
