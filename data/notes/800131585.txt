SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress: A family meeting was supposed to be held today at 2:30pm, however, mom cancelled shortly before the meeting as her support person was not present. SW and psychologist Dr. Chavis Patterson called mom to check in and mom stated that she started to have a lot of anxiety and feeling overwhelmed thinking about coming to the family alone without her support person. SW validated mom's feelings and praised her for knowing her limitations. SW reinforced with mom that we can reschedule the family meeting for when her support person can be present. Mom will let SW know when they both can be available. 




Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support. 




Time Spent: 120 minutes
