Savannah was sitting up on the side of the bed, smiling and engaged.  She shared that the recent changes in her medication regiment are helping her to feel much better than she was yesterday.  She feels that the PCA reduces her pain and her vomiting has stopped.  Savannah is getting used to her new room and is open to continued support from PACT.
