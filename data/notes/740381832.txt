Additional comments:  SW consulted at the request of mother. SW contacted mother with the assistance of Spanish interpreter. Mother is requesting a ride to an important appointment in NJ today and tomorrow. SW offered the number to MotivCare however mother reports that she spoke with them and they are unable to assist. SW informed mother that we do not provide rides to appointments for parents and that mother would be responsible for finding her own means of transportation. Mother disconnected the call at that time.
