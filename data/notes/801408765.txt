SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  LSW spoke with the patient's mother on the phone to offer support and assess needs. The patient's mother continues to implement strategies to address stressors. The patient's mother shared that the parents do not feel comfortable with the patient and his brother being discharged with oxygen and tube feeding. The patient's mother does not feel that it is manageable at home. The parents would consider going home with NG feed if the patient and his brother did not require respiratory support. LSW offered emotional support and validated the patient's mother's thoughts and feelings. 


LSW reached out to case management at the mother's request to inquire if home nursing would be covered by their health insurance. 


Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
