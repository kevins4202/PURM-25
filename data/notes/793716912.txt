Father shared the latest updates he received around cardiac status, had limited information on additional testing and discussions. SW relayed this to primary team to support communication. 


Family communication: Mother presents with some intellectual disability and has diagnosed DiGeorge Syndrome. Father expressed that sometimes mother receives information and shares it with him in a way that 'doesn't make sense.' Father shared that he feels mother 'doesn't grasp some concepts' which can make sharing medical updates challenging. SW discussed that we can support including father in medical updates/conversations. SW inquired if there are additional family members that parents wish to include in medical conversations, and parents declined.
