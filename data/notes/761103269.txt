   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Baby Girl Kiyana Garretson
CHOP MRN#: 56906730
DOB:  10/17/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  11/23/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  12:58 PM


Problems: 
Finances and Housing


Progress: Improved. SW met with the mother who has been staying at the McDonalds House since the patient was in the NICU. The mother is a single parent who lives with the patient in Atlantic City, NJ. (Please see a very recent SW assessment by NICU SW, Ali Pomar, dated 11/17/22, for more complete details). Mother lost a baby 2 years ago here at CHOP in the NICU so it is quite understandable that she may have some emotional highs and lows as noted if any particular treatments or triggers of anything associated with this patient's care may remind her of the past. The mother is employed at the Hard Rock casino in AC but has taken time off to be with the patient and she is very active in caring for the patient. The mother was very calm and receptive to support from this SW, expressed that shew is looking forward to the scheduled surgery next week for the GTube. The mother did not indicate any specific needs for SW at the present time though SW has learned that she has not been eating much recently as she misses meals at McDonalds House since she is almost always here.


Plan: SW will follow closely to assess for needs such as for supportive counseling and concrete support. SW has approved 2 meal vouchers per day through 11/28/22.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
