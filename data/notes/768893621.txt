SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  Covering SW spoke with parents at bedside as dad declined to meet with Joanne Stow, ENT NP who came to address parents questions regarding bronchoscopy in further detail on behalf of Ian Jacobs, ENT Attending who had a medical emergency that conflicted with the meeting.  Dad noted regardless of ENT NP's expertise and knowledge he wanted to speak directly to who was in the room with his daughter when performing the bronchoscopy.  SW noted to follow up with Dr. Jacobs to reconvene with dad.  Dad was very understanding of medical emergency conflict and noted a phone call would be sufficient.  Dr. Jacobs noted to follow up with dad via phone.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
