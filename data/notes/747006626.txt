SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient will have adequate insurance coverage to obtain necessary medical care
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  Social worker spoke with mother by phone. Parents chose Keystone First Medicaid as the HMO plan for the twins' secondary PA Medical Assistance. Mother noted it will be active effective 10/15/2022. Encouraged mother to bring in a copy of the twins' Keystone First insurance card once they arrive to add to the twins' charts. Twins have straight PA Medical Assistance effective retroactive to their date of birth, which is reflected in the twins' charts. No other immediate social work needs identified. 




Plan: Social worker will continue to follow. Will continue to collaborate with CICU social worker Gino Poliziani, who is following Lillian's twin sister. 




Time Spent: 15 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
