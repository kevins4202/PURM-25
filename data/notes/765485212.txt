Progress: SW spoke with Lisa from ODF who confirmed that the mortgage payment was sent to the mortgage company and the check has been cashed. Lisa from ODF sent SW the payment receipt to provide the mortgage company with proof of payment.


SW called Mom and shared the above. Mom was grateful for SW and ODF collaboration to confirm proof of payment. SW emailed Mom the receipt ODF sent SW to send to the mortgage company. Mom thanked SW.


SW and Mom set up a video call with Yaseen today at 1pm. SW facilitated the video call between Mom and Yaseen. Yaseen was laying in his bed and was happy and engaged throughout the call. Yaseen pulled on several wires and lines throughout the call, which SW redirected him away from.


Mom talked about what Yaseen is like at home and what he enjoys to do at home with his siblings and dog. Mom is looking forward to having Yaseen home again. Mom shared that she was in a lot of pain yesterday, but is feeling a little better today.


Mom thanked SW again for the call. SW discussed possibly setting up another call for Thursday or Friday this week. Mom in agreement.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. SW will reach out to Mom again later in the week about another video call.
