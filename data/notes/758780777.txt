Demarcus Hayes is a 4-month-old male who presented to the CHOP ED from OSH (CareWell Health Medical Center Emergency Room) on 11/11/22 due to an unexplained out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Mother was present at patient bedside and provided admission history to the CPT (SW, rotating resident, and Fellow-Dr. Darwiche) in patient's private room. Mother stated that on Thursday (11/10) patient woke up as normal and had a normal day. Mother stated that patient and patient's 1yr old brother woke up around 7:30am-8:00am and Mother fed both children as normal. Mother stated that she, Father, and both children later went to a local corner store and then returned home. Mother stated that she then had a orientation from 1pm-3pm at a hotel for a new position at the Newark Airport. Mother stated that Father cared for patient and patient's brother while Mother was at the orientation. Mother stated that Father picked her up from the orientation and they then all went home and were "chilling" for the rest of the night. Mother stated that later that evening she bathed, fed, and burped patient and she prepared him for bed. Mother stated that patient went to sleep around 9-9:20PM in his bassinet that is in her room. Mother stated that she has a king size bed and patient sleeps in a bassinet that is close to her bed. Mother stated that she put patient to sleep on his side and she stated that she laid a blanket on patient as she normally does. Mother stated that patient also has a favorite towel and Mother draped the towel over the side of the bassinet to allow patient to feel the towel on his face. Mother stated that she went to bed around 10PM and she stated that Father was in their studio that is located in a back room of the house. Mother stated that Paternal Uncle and Paternal Cousin were also over and they were in the studio recording music. Mother stated that around 11:50pm-12:00am, Father checked on patient and patient's brother as he normally does. Mother stated that Father started giving patient kisses as he normally does and he observed that patient was unresponsive. Father immediately woke Mother up and Mother started doing CPR. Mother stated that while she was doing CPR, there was blood coming out of patient's mouth. Mother stated that they then called 911; however, the ended up driving patient to the OSH due to the ambulance taking too long. Mother stated that the hospital is located 7 minutes away and due to light traffic, they were able to drive to the hospital in 3 minutes. While at OSH, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated, and subsequently transported to CHOP for further medical management.
