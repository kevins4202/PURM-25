   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Renee Holton
CHOP MRN#: 56876687
DOB:  7/30/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  9/29/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  7:51 AM


Problems: 
Home care, Hospital discharge and Placement


Progress: Improved. SW contacted Supervisor, Shannon Lehr, 610-829-4546, to address the confusion from the past weekend when the mother, father, and MGF, were here and gave the impression that they are living together when earlier reports from the assigned CYS SW, Sandy Jones, reported that the patient is going home with the father who would be caring for the patient and supported by the PGM. Mr. Lehr reported that the father is going home with the father who lives separately from the mother and MGF, as it is indicated on the Safety Plan. Ms. Lehr plans to speak with the family and particularly the mother who has been reported by our Staff during earlier conversations when she reportedly gave the impression that the patient is going to live with her. The mother still requires supervision when in contact with the patient. 


Plan: Continue discharge planning updates with CYS.


Time Spent: 15 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
