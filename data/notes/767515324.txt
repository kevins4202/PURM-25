DOB:  11/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  12/22/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  9:49 AM


Problems: 
Discharge Planning


Progress:
SW contacted DHS worker Kelli Seibert at 9:08am to discuss discharge planning. Kelli did not answer at the time of call.


At 9:40am, Kelli called SW back and we discussed the plans for discharge. Kelli still plans to pick up the patient and drop him off to aunt's, Latifah Reddy, home. SW asked for Kelli to contact and coordinate a time with aunt as she may have to work. It had also been advised to discharge at a time that does not interrupt that patient's feeds, so SW will check in with a time and let DHS know.


Kelli called SW back at 10:15am to inquire about speaking to someone from the medical team and SW shared she will find out who will be the best person to talk to today and provide the number.


SW was able to get the FLC's number and SW called Kelli back at 11:10am and again at 11:56am and was not able to reach Kelli. SW also called DHS Supervisor to provide the contact information but the phone went to voicemail and a message could not be left. 


Plan: 
Follow up with DHS worker Kelli to provide the necessary information for discharge.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
