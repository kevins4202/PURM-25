Coping with illness/disability  


LSW met with Mom and Naimlynne at bedside for routine support. Mom shared that she is coping as well as possible and is trying to remain focused on Naimlynne's goals and next steps. Naimlynne also expressed that she is coping well. Mom expressed the hope to have collection done at Main during this admission if possible to prevent having to travel back and forth. Mom is mostly focused on Naimlynne's ANC improving to foster the best results for collection. Transportation is a barrier to going home but would not be an issue if Naimlynne would transfer to LVH. No other immediate needs expressed. LSW will continue to follow for ongoing support.
