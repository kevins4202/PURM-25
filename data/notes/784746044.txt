Progress: PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Musheno) met with Savannah and her mother (Stephanie) at bedside to provide ongoing support following transfer to the PICU overnight.  Savannah shared that she was doing okay today.  She feels that her pain is still in a much better spot than it had been and that the PCA is feeling well for her.  She is still having some stomach cramping but she also feels that some of it as hungry.  She is hoping that her diet can advance from clears as this is the biggest thing bothering her right now.
