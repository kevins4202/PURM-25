SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress:  LSW spoke with Gisselle's mother on the phone with the assistance of Spanish Interpretalk Interpreter. The patient's mother continues to cope appropriately with Gisselle's hospitalization. 


Gisselle's mother shared that parents do not want Gisselle to have a feeding tube at the time of discharge. Parents understand that it will take Gisselle time to learn to feed by mouth and are comfortable with her remaining hospitalized as a result. LSW encouraged the patient's mother to talk with the medical team about their goals and discuss expectation surrounding nutrition. 


The patient's mother completed the SSI interview and is awaiting the application decision. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
