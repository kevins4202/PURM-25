Progress: PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Morrison, MD Mejia) met with father (Victor) at bedside to introduce the role of PACT, assess needs and provide support.

Victor expressed that Leo seems to be surpassing expectations and wants to follow his son's lead while recognizing that Leo has a long journey and hospitalization ahead.  Victor expressed that it would be important to him to have all medical interventions tried for his son.  He shared that he and Leo's mother have not always been on the same page in terms of decision making and recognizes that our team can be a support for future decisions.
