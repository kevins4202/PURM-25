Mom wants to remain present as much as she can to be with the patient. SW shared that she will provide mom with meal vouchers so that she can order food bedside and not have to leave. Mom said she would appreciate the vouchers.


Mom also shared that the patient's dad has reached out to the local community resource that was provided yesterday to assist with food. Dad called today but did not receive a call back yet.
