ADDENDUM TO CONSULT NOTE:


LSW spoke with parents about behavioral health support as they mentioned that Brooke has previous issues with body dysmorphia, often making comments about her weight and body image. Parents are concerned how cancer treatment, chemotherapy, losing her hair, etc. will further impact these thoughts that she has had since she was around 2 years old. Per parents, Brooke has never seen a therapist about these thoughts however they have discussed it in the past. Parents expressed interest in behavioral health support and are aware that LSW can make this consult order at any time. LSW also discussed salon services and wig resources should Brooke be interested in the future. LSW spoke with parents about involving Child Life in these discussions in order to assist Brooke in processing her thoughts and concerns as well. LSW updated CLS and will continue to follow up with family about behavioral health consult as needed and desired.
