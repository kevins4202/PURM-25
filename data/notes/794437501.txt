Progress:  SW called mom to check in. She did not complete the ODF application for rent assistance, but SW explained that it can be completed for the May 10 deadline for future help. We discussed the Colette Louise application for uber credit assistance. Mom is interested and will complete it by the end of day 4/19, as applications will close then for a month. Mom reports that dad recently got a job and they are working opposite shifts. Mom expressed that she and dad discussed the GT and they want to move forward with it; SW informed the team. Mom plans to come to bedside to stay overnight closer to discharge, which SW encouraged.
