Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: Unchanged


Plan: SW t/b with parents at bedside to check in. Parents advised feeling appropriately concerned with pt's medical status the last few days, but feel this surgery was easier to process than previous surgery as course was more predictable and pt did not require delayed sternal closure. SW provided active listening/emotional support. No other needs identified at this time.


SW will continue to follow the family.




Time Spent: 15 minutes


Acuity: Level 1 - Adequate resources to meet needs
