They stated that an authorization has been resubmitted to the insurance company and the patient's mother can disregard the bill received. LSW informed the patients mother on 4/7/23. 


With the assistance of a Spanish VRI interpreter, Dr. Eichenwald, Dr. Cristante and LSW met with the patient's mother at the bedside.  The patient's mother was provided with an overall medical update. Dr. Cristante revisited the possibility that Gisselle may need to go home with a feeding tube and respiratory support but that it is still unknown at this time. The medical team discussed that Gisselle's DNR is no longer medically appropriate given her current medical needs. The patient's mother was in agreement. 


Dr. Eichenwald explained that Gisselle will likely be ready for discharge in the next several weeks. The medical team encouraged the patient's mother to travel to Mexico this month in preparation for discharge within the next few weeks. The patient's mother verbalized her agreement.
