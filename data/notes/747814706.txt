SW consulted by medical team for resource needs assessment. SW met with patient's mother, father and grandparents. Parents report finding out that Alayna will be admitted to the hospital for an extended period of time. Parents are from NJ and report it takes them approximately 2 hours (with traffic) to go back and forth to the hospital. Parents also expressed wanting to be close by due to Alayna's critical state. SW provided contact for Ronald McDonald House and explained the process of applying to stay there. SW also provided a list of hotels that provide discounted rates for CHOP families. Mother reports she works full time but is expecting to have to be off for an extended period due to hospital admission. Father reports he very recently lost his job and is unemployed. Mother and father shared there have been financial stressors associated with the admission due to not being able to quickly go home for something to eat. SW offered meal vouchers to aid with the stressor of having to purchase meals while at the hospital. Grandparents report they are able to help assist with financial barriers when they can, but feel the parents would benefit from SW support when they are not present. 
The family was appropriately upset about critical condition of Alayna and SW provided emotional support throughout discussion. Family expressed appreciation for social work support. SW encouraged them to reach out with any further needs. SW will remain available as needed.
