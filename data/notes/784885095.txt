SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  LSW met with Leo's parents at the bedside to provide support and assess coping. The patient's parents continue to cope as expected given the circumstances. 


LSW collaborated with the patient's father to identify strategies to promote healthy coping. The patient's father articulated his thoughts and feelings surrounding Leo's medical needs. 


LSW collaborated with the parents to create a plan to address stressors related to Leo's ongoing hospitalization. When the parents are not at the bedside, the medical team will call to give a plan of care update throughout the week. The parents will initiate a three way call when speaking with the medical team to help facilitate both parents receiving the update at the same time. 


LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with the parents. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
