SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing



Progress:  Social worker met with parents at bedside in the NICU. They shared how pleased they have been with Raegan's progress thus far. Parents are looking forward to completing education for Raegan's home care needs and being able to discharge home in the near future. We discussed the supports available to the family as an outpatient through CHOP and the CHOP Trisomy 21 Clinic. Parents continue to be strong and thoughtful advocates for Raegan. We discussed applying for SSI for Raegan. Social worker offered to email mother the application instructions next week as well as the income guidelines. Father's employer has been flexible about providing additional time off from work if needed as Raegan discharges home. No other immediate social work needs identified. 




Plan: Social worker will continue to follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
