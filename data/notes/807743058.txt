Progress:  LSW met with Dasher's mother at the bedside to answer questions about secondary medicaid. The patient's mother is scheduled to call the Change Center with FHC in the afternoon to request that the patient's secondary Medicaid is back dated to his date of birth. 


Dasher's mother shared that the parents plan to move to California in September. Dasher's mother is scheduled to begin work at Stanford Hospital at the beginning of October. If possible, the parents would like for Dasher to be transferred to Stanford in September if it is medically appropriate. LSW explained the process of requesting a transfer and that it mainly depends on insurance approval. Mom discussed their request with Dr. Brandsma on rounds and agreed that it would be best to discuss the transfer in more detail when it get closer to September. 


Dasher had a coding event in the afternoon that LSW responded to. LSW offered emotional support to Dasher's mother during the code. The patient's mother shared that she felt it was her fault that he coded. The medical team assured the patient's mother that it was not her fault and provided an explanation for the event. LSW provided supportive counseling to address mom's fears and reduce stressors. Mom held and soothed Dasher in her arms following the code.




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
