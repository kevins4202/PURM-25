SW met with guardian Elizabeth Talada. SW provided copy of cardiac family resource guide. SW confirmed Elizabeth was able to obtain room at RMH today and also brought personal belongings from home. 


Elizabeth shared more about events leading to hospitalization. Elizabeth shared that Amber had rhinovirus at end of February (dx during prior admission) and her assessment is that Amber did not fully recover from this, leading to phone calls to pcp and cardiologist about nasal congestion and cough, followed by hospitalization in Geisinger PICU. Elizabeth shared that Amber was then discharged home on supplemental o2. Per Elizabeth, she contacted cardiologist about congestion and breathing, and moved up appointment earlier. Per Elizabeth, by the time they arrived to the appointment, Amber appeared 'gray' and was not responsive and 911 was called. SW provided emotional support as Elizabeth reflected on recent events.


SW will continue to follow.
