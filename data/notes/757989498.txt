Progress:  LSW spoke with Umar's father at the bedside with the assistance of VRI Russian interpreter. Akmal provided LSW with the remaining documents needed for Umar's medicaid application. LSW provided the patient's father with instructions on how to apply for SSI for Umar. The parents plan to call SSI to begin the process. The patient's father continues to cope appropriately given the circumstances and is receptive to social work support. 
LSW suggested that an in person Russian interpreter be present for the medical team to provide parents with a medical update. Akmal reported that the parents feel the phone and VRI interpreters have been sufficient and do not need an in person interpreter at this time. LSW stressed that if the medical team feels that the information is not being relayed properly that an in person interpreter will be ordered. The patient's father verbalized understanding. 


LSW forwarded all documentation received to FHC. 


Plan: LSW will continue to follow and assess needs.
