Addendum 5/31/23 at 4:50 PM:
Met briefly with mother at bedside in the NICU. Mother was able to connect with NICU psychologist. Mother shared how she has been coping. She is coping as well as can be expected at this time considering Quinn's unanticipated illness. No immediate social work needs identified.
