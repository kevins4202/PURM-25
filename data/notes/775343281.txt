Progress: Ongoing


SW participated in medical rounds with the Pulmonary Care Team.


SW clarified that disposition is dependent on the outcome of the upcoming 2/6/2023 family court hearing. Per prior discussions between SW and CYS, dispo will be discharge to Mother vs. discharge with Maternal Grandmother. Either way, both caregivers will remain involved in care of Mirajh. Team agreeable for both Mother and MGM to begin caregiver teaching while awaiting outcome of court hearing.


SW met with Mother at bedside for re-assessment of concrete resource needs. Mother has no income currently and is unable to return home frequently to access resources. Family remains eligible for concrete resource assistance via SWEF. SW approved as outlined below, with plan to re-assess later this week.


Patient is eligible and Social Work provided the following resources:  Meal Vouchers: 8.
Reason for Disbursement: Other hardship considerations: Limited income, extended admission


Mother also inquired about childcare for her other children when MGM needs to come to bedside for training. SW attempted to contact Lancaster County CYS Caseworker Olivia Jones (717-606-5206) to discuss options for support, as siblings cannot stay at bedside and family is not eligible for Ronald McDonald House. SW left voice mail for Caseworker.


Plan: SW will continue to follow.


Time Spent: 60 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
