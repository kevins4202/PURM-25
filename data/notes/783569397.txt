SW will check in with parents when they are at the bedside. SW assessed for further need of resources. Meal vouchers approved and entered. Parent will pick up at the admissions desk. 


UPDATE: Met with mother when she arrived. Mom explained why she was not at the bedside the last 2 days.  She stated she and dad were looking at houses and doing laundry. SW informed mother that we do not expect her to be at the bedside all of the time as we know there are other children to take care of. SW just asked mom to continue to let the bedside nurse know when she will not be present so that team an request bed side buddy if needed.
