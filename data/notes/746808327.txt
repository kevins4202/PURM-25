Honesty Johnson is a 2 year old female (DOB: 11/2/2020) with no chronic medical conditions, presenting to the CHOP trauma bay, transferred from an OSH after a dog attack. Patient arrived intubated and sedated. SW introduced self to mother and explained the social work role while in the trauma bay. SW provided emotional support to mother while in the bay. Mother reported she felt "crowded" in the trauma bay. While in the bay, mother received a phone call from her father (maternal grandfather) that he was in the ED waiting room. Mother left the bay to receive emotional support from her family in the waiting room. Mother and North East Philadelphia Detective, Thomas Walsh (badge 9178, 215-686-3154) presented back to the the trauma bay. Detective Walsh requested a private room to speak with mother. SW directed mother and Detective Walsh to ED 5. Once the interview was complete, SW assisted mother to the CT waiting room and ultimately to the PICU. SW handed off case to PICU SW's Tressa Dabney and Shawna Weiss. 


Social work will continue to follow as needed throughout the patient's admission.
