Progress:   LSW spoke with Family Services at the RMD house to submit a room request for the patient's parents. The request was submitted and the RMD house will reach out to the patient's parents directly to discuss the next steps. The family hopes that a room will be available on Monday. The parents were made aware that the room request was completed. 


LSW met with the patient's mother at the patient's bedside to offer support and assess needs. The patient's mother shared that she is experiencing increased levels of anxiety leaving the patient and her children at home. LSW provided supportive counseling and collaborated with mom to create a plan to address stressors. LSW encouraged the patient's mother to utilize community resources for additional support.


LSW will meet with the mother next week to provide ongoing support. 


No additional needs reported at this time. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and assess needs during the patient's hospitalization.
