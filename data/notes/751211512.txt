Progress:  Social worker spoke with mother by phone on 10/10/22. Mother is coping as well as can be expected considering Shavaeha's illness and subsequent readmission to the NICU. Mother does not drive and relies on extended family members for a ride to the hospital and is also considering taking Septa to visit Shavaeha at CHOP. Social worker offered to request a NICU social work fund gift card to offset the cost of transportation (for public transportation or to offset the cost of gas and tolls). Social worker sent a text message to mother on 10/11/22 with public transportation direction per her request. Mother appreciative. Mother identified no other immediate social work needs at this time.
