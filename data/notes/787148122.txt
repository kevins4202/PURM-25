 The Children's Hospital 
of Philadelphia 



SOCIAL WORK NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Samantha Fraser
CHOP MRN#: 56968868
DOB:  3/15/2023
TODAY'S DATE:  3/17/2023
TODAY'S TIME: 1:54 PM


Patient and family screened today for Social Work needs.  


Additional Comments: Riley's parents and grandmother were visited on the SDU. Riley's mother, Chrissy, will be in the SDU for at least one more night. Chrissy's mother generally stays with her in the SDU. Riley's father, Lucas, was also in the room with Chrissy in the SDU. He will likely request a sleep room again tonight so that he can stay in the hospital near to Riley. 
Lucas's mom has now gotten a hotel room so that she can rest since arriving from Seattle at 7 am yesterday. The family is also working through the process of adding Lucas and his mom to the Ronald McDonald House room that they have. Visitation rules have been reiterated to Chrissy, Lucas and Chrissy's mom Jennifer. Lucas's mom has not been at the hospital today. 
    The family is aware that Riley continues to have health struggles, including brain findings. Chrissy and Lucas are coping as best as they can and are receiving support from social work and psychology. I will follow up tomorrow afternoon when I come in for a weekend shift on 3/18. I will provide sign out to the Red team social worker on Monday 3/20.
  Chrissy and I spoke about insurance for Riley. She will be working to add him on to her Washington State medicaid plan. Chrissy also carries insurance through her dad. It is unlikely that she can add the baby to that plan. He would not be eligible for PA MA.
