Progress:  LSW met with the patient's mother at the bedside several times throughout the week to assess coping and provide support. Patient's mother is coping as expected given the circumstances. Leo's mother is actively implementing strategies to promote healthy coping and is collaborating with LSW to address stressors. 


On 12/21/22 LSW met with Leo's father away from the bedside to collect documentation for Leo's medicaid application. Documentation was scanned and sent to Family Health Coverage. Patient's father requested for a change to be made to the visitation schedule so that he can be at the bedside during the day time. LSW informed the patient's father that changes could not be made on a weekly basis. LSW assured the patient's father that a change to the visitation schedule could be made on Tuesday 12/27. Patient's father verbalized his understanding. LSW will follow up with both parents on Tuesday 12/27 to create a new visitation schedule. 




Plan: LSW will follow up with the patient's parents on Tuesday 12/27 to make changes to the visitation schedule.
