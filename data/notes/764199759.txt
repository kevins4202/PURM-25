Meal voucher provided(2)


Additional Comments: SW extended meal assistance, 2 per day, for the mother a couple more days just in case it's needed. SW provided the mother with some tips on good potential housing areas in South Jersey that are close to Philadelphia, and, options for outpatient Peds management that accepts Horizon NJ Health HMO Medicaid with ENT, since NJ Medicaid is No Par with CHOP and only allows 1 post discharge Specialist appointment before the family is required to have follow-up in NJ. The current PCP can request Medicaid coverage of a CHOP Care Network appointment(s) that will at times be accepted by Medicaid.


It is still a good idea to give the mother a prescription for the formula to give to WIC even though the Home Care company , Option Care will provide the formula as it may be needed later, after Option Care is no longer needed and the formula may still be the preferred source of nutrition, then WIC can supplement a contributing supply.
