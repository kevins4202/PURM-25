CHOP MRN#: 56895109
DOB:  9/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  10/3/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  8:46 AM


Problems: 
Conflict within family 


Progress: Unchanged


Plan: 


SW met with Mom and MGM at the bedside per the family's request. Mom stated that she went to court today to file for emergency custody of the patient. Mom verbally stated that this was granted, and provided SW with court documents. After review SW stated that unfortunately these documents that Mom provided do not grant Mom emergency custody. SW reviewed the documents with Mom, who continued to insist that she was granted emergency custody of the patient and the patients sibling, resulting in Dad not being able to have visitation with either child. SW stated that this is not what the documentation provided states, and Mom will need to return to the courts to obtain either correct documentation, or once again request emergency custody. 


Mom provided SW with a PFA for Dad, however the PFA only included Mom, not the children. Mom stated that she is required to return to court on Monday to obtain additional information. 


SW will continue to follow. No changes to be made to the visitation schedule a this time. Dad is still permitted to visit, however will not be permitted to be in the room at the same time as Mom. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
