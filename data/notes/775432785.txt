SW met with foster mom at bedside. She reports that biological mom and she both travel back and forth to bedside. Foster mom expressed some ongoing financial stress related to admission, as she has not been working since pt was admitted (she babysits several children). Foster father took sick time last week, but returned to work today. She requested further concrete resources, which SW approved. Also explained the possibility of foundation assistance should admission last; she does not report a crisis at this time. Bio mom returned to the room; SW offered support.


SW also arranged a phone update with prison case manager for biological dad. Case worker is Kelly Ford (610-782-3140) and doctor will call tomorrow.
