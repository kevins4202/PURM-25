SW reached out to the FHCP to check the status of insurance application. SW was informed that Mom insurace application is pending. Below is the email received.


"Hello Saliyah,


I called and spoke to mom on Friday and she was stating that she received a letter stating that the NJMA application was pending.  Then she stated that all the information on the application did not go through so she has to resubmit the application.  I advised mom that I can assist her with the application that I would need the required documents from her.  Mom states that she will send the documents to me.  I will continue to follow up and keep you updated.


Thank You,
Rosemarie.

SW will continue to follow up with coordinator and family.
