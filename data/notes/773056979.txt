Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Demarcus Hayes 
Date of Birth:  6/23/2022 
MRN:  56917815


Progress: A family meeting was held this afternoon with Mom and Dad (Dad called in via phone). Also in attendance was MD Schaub, CCRN Trice, this SW, Rehab Medicine, OT Brundage, PACT MD Johnson, and PACT SW Dombrowski. 


Rehab Medicine reviewed Demarcus' current status and progress he has made. Parents asked questions about his future, which Rehab Medicine discussed that they have seen slow progress with Demarcus and many of their questions do not have answers right now, as he is still so young and in the early stages of therapy.


Mom shared that her primary concern for Demarcus is for him to be able to live independently. Mom expressed that she wants Demarcus to do more than lay and exist, she wants him to be able to express himself and have more of a quality of life.


Dad holds a positive outlook and encouraged positivity from Mom, as well, during the meeting. Mom shared the challenges of "being positive" and holding onto hope for "what ifs', as the person who is here with him every single day and who will be caring for him when he gets home. Mom shared that she does not have additional support and this worries her. 


Both parents are in agreement with a transfer to Children's Specialized when insurance approval goes through and a bed is available. Parents continue to be very thoughtful in their present decision making as it relates to Demarcus's future and what his future will look like.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
