Progress: PACT SW called and spoke with mother (Mirabel) to provide ongoing support using spanish interpreter via Language Line.  Mirabel shared that she is realizing the long journey her daughter is on and her hopes that Gisselle can get better.  She is understandably worried about her daughter going through all of this and appreciates ongoing, honest conversations with the team.  She also shared how hard it is to be away from her 5 yo son who remains in Mexico - she knows that she needs to be here with Gisselle but wishes she could be in both places.  Mirabel is being thoughtful about recognizing her own emotions and needs for support and has been talking this through with NICU SW Heidenreich.


Plan: PACT SW will remain available for support in conjunction with NICU SW.  


Time Spent: 30 minutes
