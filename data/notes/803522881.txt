Social work continues to follow this patient.  


Additional Comments: Extended hours SW responded to two separate Codes Blue, first when patient was on the CCU. She was then transferred to the CICU where her heart stopped during a testing procedure. Chest compressions were done and patient's heart was then shocked. SW provided support to parents away from patient's room. Parents discussed how Janiece is "such a good girl", how she plans to go to college, wants to be a teacher and loves living in the more rural area they moved to from East New York City. Mother was appropriately tearful. Parents were updated by CRNP while they were still out of the room SW accompanied parents to patient's room once the medical team gave the go ahead. Parents were updated at bedside. SW remains available to provide support.


Time Spent: 90 minutes
