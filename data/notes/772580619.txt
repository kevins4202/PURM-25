Progress: 
SW called mom to check in to see how she was doing and to assess for needs. Mom shared that everything this good and she has no needs at the moment that she can think of. Only question mom had was due to patient's cleft palate, she was wondering if/when the patient can take bottle by mouth, would she need special bottles and if so, will they be covered by insurance.
SW shared that she will direct this question to the respective party. Mom shared there was no rush on the answer, she is just trying to think ahead.
SW encouraged mom to reach out if any additional needs arise.
