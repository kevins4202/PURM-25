PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Tiesha Reddy
CHOP MRN#: 56917884
DOB:  11/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  1/4/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  11:20 AM


Problems: 
Discharge Planning/Custody and Consent


Progress:
SW stopped by bedside and aunt was present and active in patient's care. SW made aunt aware that the vouchers that were requested yesterday had been avaible at the Resource Desk.


At 10:40am, SW contacted DHS worker Kelli Seibert to receive an update on discharge planning and custody. Kelli shared that DHS is still firm on the home nursing for discharge even though aunt is willing to take a leave until nursing is available. SW made her aware that there is a staffing barrier with the home nursing so it may take weeks. SW inquire about additional DHS options as the patient no longer needs to be hospitalized and is medically cleared. SW stressed the importance of patient being discharged. Kelli shared that a medical foster home could take months and since family is present and active, they would like to continue to explore family option. SW did inform Kelli that a medical facility is also being explored by our Case Management, but that could also take weeks if accepted. 
SW will follow up and send an email to DHS and include the medical team to receive additional information and clarification on this case. 


Plan: 
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
