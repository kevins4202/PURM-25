Progress:  SW received a call from pt's aunt this morning reporting she could come to bedside today at 11:00 for scheduled teaching. SW determined that CHHC had scheduled pump teaching and notified CHHC, who will reschedule at a later time.
Discussed pt in discharge rounds today and will plan for discharge week of 5/8 with GT and oxygen if needed, but will attempt to wean pt off oxygen before then.
SW called pt's aunt, Melissa. Informed her of the above and that we will put in a referral to the Family Learning Center for GT class. (SW confirmed with CUA worker that grandmother, Jeanette Keys, can and should get teaching.) SW confirmed with Melissa that her mother will come with her to class; she inquired about scheduling this on the wknds, which SW explained she could. SW explained that CHHC will reschedule pump teaching at the bedside with her. SW suggested she visit bedside during the day during the week several days during the week before discharge to become familiar with pt's care and meet providers. Also discussed a 12-24 hour stay, depending on pt's needs. Pt's sibling attends Karabots for PMD, so pt can attend there too.
SW spoke to DHS RN, Alita Thompson, to inform her of the above. Left a msg for CUA worker to contact me for the above update.
Will call parents tomorrow to inform them of the above.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
