SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Progress:  SW intern met with parents by the bedside. SW intern and clinical nurse supervisor Emily Larkins met with parents to review ongoing issues with adherence to sleep room policy. SW intern and CNS discussed that if parents are not able to adhere to the NICU sleep room policies again, their sleep room privileges will be taken away until further notice. Parents verbalized understanding of our discussion. 


Parents shared how emotionally challenging it has been having Lily in the NI/ICU. They discussed other stressors outside of the NICU, including financial resource stressors and searching for housing in Philadelphia where they plan to relocate to. SW intern provided supportive counseling. SW intern informed parents of financial assistance granted by Harp's Hope in the form of 2 gift cards for food and gas. Parents were very appreciative. SW intern coordinated with psychology to reschedule psychology meeting for today (4/4) at 12 pm. No other immediate social work needs identified at this time. 


Plan: SW intern to follow and offer emotional support and resources as needed.
