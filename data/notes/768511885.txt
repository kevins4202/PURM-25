Hospitalization 


Progress: SW met with mom and dad bedside to offer SW support. Mom reported she is currently out of work on FMLA due to giving birth. Dad asked questions regarding the difference in collecting unemployment and FMLA. Father explained further he is a truck driver and this is a slow time of year for the business. SW and father spoke about FMLA protecting his job, however he reported his job would be protected. SW left it up to father to decide and offered support either way. 


SW also spoke with parents about PA secondary MA. Mom and both reported bring stressed about the cost of the current hospital stay and also the medical costs moving forward. SW referred the family to FHCP for assistance. The SW LOMN was signed by Dr. Smith and she reported she would also work on the PA 586 form. FHCP reported they would reach out to the family once those forms were received. 




Father also reported issues in the parking garage the other day. He reported the machine was broke and they made him pay $64 dollars to get his car out. Both mother and father reported this was a stressor. SW problem solved with them, and SW assessed the need to replace $50 for them due to the financial hardship of a prolonged hospital stay. SW provided 2 $25 gift cards to bedside. SW also provided mom and dad with meal vouchers and parking passes for assistance moving forward.


Mother and father seemed to coping well. SW encouraged both parents to practice self care. SW assured them CHOP staff takes very great care of children, if they felt like they needed to step away from bedside. SW also ensured them this SW is available for any social work needs which arise. 


Parents seemed to appreciate the SW check in and assistance.
