SW met with mom after meeting as well. Informed her that Colette Louise foundation will add the award to her Septa keycard and will purchase meal vouchers for delivery to the room. SW inquired about how parents' housing search is going. Mom expressed that she and dad have been discussing things and that they would like to pursue a transitional care facility for pt at this time. She reports that there is not room where they currently live for pt to go at discharge and she does not think they can find their own housing before discharge. Mom also expressed that pt will need a lot of care and she would like more time to learn her care. SW explained that parents would get teaching and could practice at bedside, but also understand if parents need more time. SW explained that I would inform CM, who could talk with mom about options, although the ones in Philadelphia are limited.
