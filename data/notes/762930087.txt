Family meeting held with both parents, Vietnamese interpreter, PCA (MD Lin, LSW Davila, RN), Neurology (MD Caligiuri, MD Markwalter), Genetics, Pulmonary, and PACT (LSW Dombrowski, MD Hwang) Parents had thoughtful questions in knowing about Carey's diagnosis/mutation what her life might look like in the future -from both a physical and development perspective.  They are hopeful to know more about whether Carey will be able to identify them as her parents and know they are present.   Teams expressed that given her genetic mutation and MRI there is concern that Carey will have global developmental delay.  There is worry that she may not be able to walk, talk or sit on her own.  There are concerns about the severity of her hearing and vision loss.   Family was appropriately upset in hearing the potential severity of Carey's impact on development. Carey remains at risk for seizures as well. 


Ultimately, Carey's parents would want to take her home to Vietnam.  They recognize that this may not be possible in the short and/or long term.  They are unsure if they could take her home while she is needing ventilator support given the differences of resources in Vietnam. They also express that PT/OT/SLP is not available in their home country. They are clear that if her care levels require, they will have her stay here in the United States.  They are considering whether they would be able to take Carey home locally in Philadelphia and are considering finding a larger apartment.  They would also like to tour several facilities to see if this would be an option for Carey.


Carey's father is in law School at Upenn.  He is scheduled to graduate May 2023 but his school is helping him apply to defer so that he can focus on Carey's needs and care.  Family is currently on a student visa and has questions about how to think about longer term visas if Carey remains in the United States.  The school  Is supporting dad in this process.  PACT SW will also provide documentation for the family to bring to the Embassy.  Carey has a healthy twin brother - family has questions about insurance for him - they are unsure if he has medical assistance.  PCU SW will contact Family Health coverage program to see if they can verify his coverage.
