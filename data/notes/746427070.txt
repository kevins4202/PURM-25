SW met with mom and dad at bedside to introduce social worker role and offer support. Parents report they have a 6 year old son and 9 year old daughter that are currently staying with friends who are able to get them to school. Dad's parents live close by to them in NJ. Mom's mother lives in ND and brother lives in Minnesota. Dad works full time at a small company and is currently out on unpaid leave. Mom was just starting a new job and supposed to start this past Saturday. Parents voiced concerns about finances which social work will continue to follow up on. They rent a home at this time. 
Mom expressed concern for anxiety and depression. SW will follow up with mom.


SW will continue to follow for support and concrete resources.
