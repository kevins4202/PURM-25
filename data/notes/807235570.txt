TODAY'S DATE:  6/14/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  10:16 AM


Problems: 
Hospital discharge and Placement


Progress: Ongoing. SW spoke with CYS SW this AM about the process of obtaining authorization for the patient's release to the foster parents. If there is a strong anticipation for a medical clearance, I.e, on Friday, 6/16, then CYS must be advised of this by 6/15 am and no later than early afternoon. SW was advised that the CYS Attorneys must have the discharge date on the paperwork presenting in Court for the Judge on the same day of discharge for an emergency order that like Philly's DHS' (Order of protective Custody-OPC), must be requested on the same day of medical clearance for discharge. A court order in cases like this are not obtainable on weekends.


Plan: Please contact this SW ASAP when there is a anticipated date of medical clearance if that is possible to do.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
