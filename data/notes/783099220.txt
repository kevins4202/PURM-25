Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW and CCRN met with Mom at the bedside. Yaseen was smiling and calm throughout our visit and responded positively to Mom's presence.


SW provided Mom with the ABAS 3 at the bedside. SW called an Arabic Interpreter and offered to do it with Mom together, but Mom opted to take it home and have her son translate for her. Mom agreed to bring the packet back this weekend and leave it at the bedside, or next week when she visits again.


SW discussed what the packet is and how to answer the questions. SW encouraged Mom to leave any questions that she is unsure of blank and SW and Mom can go through it together. Mom in agreement. Mom denied any other questions or concerns. 


Mom confirmed she has all documents needed for the IDS registration, but may need to order a new birth certificate. Mom will look when she goes home and let SW know if she cannot locate the BC and SW will guide Mom on next steps.


Mom shared recent difficulties with a Security Officer not allowing her to park in the Main Garage because "she does not have a child with her" and will only allow her to park in Buerger. Mom relayed that this does not happen every time she comes, only when it is that specific Security Officer at the stand. SW advised that Mom call SW if this happens again and SW can talk with the Security Officer and clarify that Mom is visiting her son in the hospital. 


Mom denied any other questions or concerns at this time.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. 


Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
