Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: Initial meeting held today with parents, CM Julie Sabokar, Respiratory Supervisor Susmita, Continuity RN Molly Everhart, Hospitalist Lauren Leavesley. 


Due to current housing situation, parents are not able to take patient directly home. The team discussed transitional care center with family. Parents were encouraged to train and learn patient's care as long as he is inpatient so that they could be ready if housing comes together. Parents do not have a car so a facility that is accessible by public transportation is preferred. 


Plan: SW will continue meeting with mother and father to assess for psychosocial needs and provide supportive counseling.


Parents will fill out training calender. CM will make referrals to TCC. Plan will be to reconvene to discuss training progress and obtain any updates on housing. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes
