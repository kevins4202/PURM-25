Progress:  Social worker met briefly with father at bedside on 10/13/22 and with mother at bedside on 10/14/22. Overall, parents are coping well at this time considering Ella's readmission to the NICU. Completed a Harp's Hope application with mother on 10/14/22 to offset the cost of gas expenses traveling daily to CHOP to visit Ella. Also provided meal vouchers and parking vouchers. Discussed applying for financial assistance next week to offset the cost of Ella's hospitalizations. Mother in agreement. Catholic Community Services CUA worker, Cydney Simmons (215-431-5855), visited patient in the hospital today. Progress note provided per CUA worker's request (ROI scanned to chart and quick disclosure completed). No other immediate social work needs identified.
