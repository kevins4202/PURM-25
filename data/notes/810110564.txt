Progress:  SW received a call from Jessica Walker, DCF case worker due to report made at Virtua for mom's prescribed medical THC use during pregnancy.  Mom had discussed report at time of SW assessment however DCF hadn't communicated they had not closed the case.  Ms. Walker noted she successfully visited the patient today, received an update from FLC, and was closing the case.  SW processed with mom and provided emotional support as mom felt nature of support and investigation was discriminatory and conducted inadequately which mom noted she was following up on.  Mom appreciated support from SW and ultimately glad case was closed.   


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
