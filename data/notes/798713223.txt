SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress:  Fellow Timothy Nelin MD, FLC Alexandra Veech PA-C and LSW met with the patient's mother and great grandmother at the bedside to discuss discharge planning. Dr. Nelin provided an overall medical update and highlighted that the goal for next week is to wean the patient and his brother off of all respiratory support. If the patients tolerate the respiratory wean, they would be safe to be discharged with NG tube feeding. If parents were uncomfortable with NG tube feeding at home, the patient and his brother could remain hospitalized until they are able to take all their nutrition by mouth. The patient's parents are eager to have the twins home but are hesitant for them to be discharged with tube feeding. Parents will discuss the options and the medical team will touch base with parents next week.


Dr. Nelin helped to set expectations for timeline of discharge and stressed to the patient's mother that there is not a set date at this time and will depend on the patient's ROP exam and respiratory wean.  


The patient's mother was made aware of the teaching requirements for a safe discharge and was encouraged to ask nursing about tube feeding while at the bedside. 




Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
