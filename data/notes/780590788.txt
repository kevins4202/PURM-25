Patient parents were each coping appropriately as they prepared for Azuri`s extubation. Patient father gave Azuri her pacifier and watched over her as she looked up at patient father.
Patient mother engaged with Azuri as well.


Patient parents plan to utilize coping strategies recommended by LSW.


LSW circled back later and parents were supporting Azuri after she was extubated. Patient parents were coping appropriately.
