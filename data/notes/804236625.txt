Providing coverage for trauma SW today. Discussed patient with bedside nurse, nursing leadership, and PICU FLC.


SW and bedside nurse met with mom and adult sister to provide support and to discuss questions around visitation. We reviewed current institutional guidance around visitation as well as patient's current authorized visitation restriction. Mom reported she would like patient's final designated visitor to be paternal aunt Jill Marie Brown. Mom said paternal aunt is supportive of the family. Dad arrived at the end of our discussion and voiced agreement. Parents stated paternal aunt will not be coming tonight due to visiting hours and her distance from the hospital. Encouraged family to continue talking about visitation overnight, with a plan to confirm if paternal aunt will be the designated visitor tomorrow (6/1).


Mom stated she is in the process of adding dad to her room at RMH, with a plan for them to take turns at the bedside moving forward. We reinforced the continued importance of family's self-care.


Mom asked several thoughtful questions related to navigating an unexpected hospitalization while balancing external needs and responsibilities, and is receptive to ongoing SW support.
