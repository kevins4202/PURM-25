Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaribeth Pabon 
Date of Birth:  1/22/2010 
MRN:  56963221


Progress: SW met with Mom at the bedside and completed the remainder of Mom's SSI paperwork with her. SW submitted the paperwork on Mom's behalf via fax (866-747-4916). 


SW and Mom discussed the planned visit from Voorhees Pediatrics today. We looked up where Voorhees is located on the map, and Mom felt that about a 40 minute drive could be doable for her to get a ride from her niece. Mom shared that she is now debating remaining in her home rather than moving due to rent being so high in other properties. Mom shared that their rodent issue has subsided and she spoke with her landlord who is willing to make renovations to the floors, walls, etc. During SW visit, CM and Voorhees arrived to meet Yari and Mom, so SW deferred to their meeting. 


SW later attended a family meeting with Mom, Maternal Aunt Betsy (via Teams), CCRN Locke, MD Albahri, MD Mayer (Pulmonary), NP Kerith Hiatt (Pulmonary), and an in person Spanish Interpreter to discuss Yari's hospital course with her respirator needs and the plan moving forward. The option for orthopedic surgery was briefly discussed and we shared that MD Baldwin and his team will talk with Mom more in depth about that option.


Mom and Maternal Aunt asked appropriate questions throughout. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow.
