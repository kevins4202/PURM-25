Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW spoke with Mom over the phone this afternoon.


SW provided a supportive check in. SW inquired about Mom's progress with identifying a therapist. Mom confirmed that she spoke with Magellan BH, but they were unable to identify an Arabic speaking therapist. SW asked if Mom called the places SW sent a while back who had sliding scale options. Mom did not and asked that SW resend the email, which SW did after the call. Mom will follow up with them. SW offered to look into additional options for Mom. Mom reported that her overall mood has been better ever since things have stabilized better with Yaseen. Mom shared that she has "up and down days", but overall, she has been feeling better. 


Mom shared that she called the Birth Certificate agency and they informed her that her request was canceled and she submitted a new request. Mom is going to send SW the confirmation email for SW to also keep an eye on the process. 


Mom denied any other SW needs at this time. 


Plan: New birth certificate has been ordered. SW will look into additional BH resources for Mom. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes
