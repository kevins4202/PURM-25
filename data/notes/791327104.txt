Progress: 


SW spoke with Lebanon County CYS Caseworker Michelle Curry to provide a medical update and share questions/concerns raised by foster family. CYS shared that they would defer to hospital policy regarding creating a visitation schedule. SW offered to collaborate with bio and foster families in developing a schedule if agreed on by all parties. SW was unable to reach bio mother x2 and unable to leave voicemail. No schedule has been created at this time. Foster parents are amenable to leaving bedside if bio family is visiting. 


Bio mother, bio father, and bio sibling have visited the hospital, all permitted to visit for 3 hours. SW confirmed with CYS that sibling is permitted to visit per their guidelines.


Ethan will be discharged home with foster parents, Megan and Luke Larsen.
