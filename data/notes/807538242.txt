Progress: SW met with patient's father who was present at bedside. Patient's father reports that they were doing well and have no needs at this time. 


SW later received a call from nursing stating that mom's phone is not accepting calls and we have no way to reach her. SW reached out to CUA worker Lisa Crump who stated that mom's phone was lost and should have a replacement in the coming days. However, she sated that patient's father is able to give consent if anything arises.
