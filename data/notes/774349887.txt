Progress:
SW stopped by bedside while patient's mom and dad were present. SW is familiar with the family from previous admissions, so SW checked in. SW provided additional information on NJ Medicaid and SSI as parents are interested in secondary insurance. SW also let the family know that their Open Door application had been submitted and we are just waiting to hear back on the decision. SW will keep them informed of this.
Mom then shared that she is a bit out of it at the moment as she received news that was not good about the patient. Mom did not share but asked for some time at this moment. SW said she will revisit the family and check back in.


Plan: 
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
