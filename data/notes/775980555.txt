Problems: 
Discharge Planning-DCPP


Progress:
SW received an email from family's SW from DCPP, Michael Fogg, reiterating that pateint's mom home is officially ready. Michael had inquired about a discharge date. SW shared the tentative discharge date and informed him that if this changes, SW will let him know.
Michael will be in need of the discharge summary once discharged. 


SW later called mom at 2:15pm to inquire about additional support at home for the patient as it relates to a second caregiver. Mom shared that maternal grandmother will be the second caregiver and will be able to complete the trainings as well. Mom also asked if she can do the overnight 12 hour stay this Friday. SW told mom that she will relay the request to the team and someone will be in touch soon to coordinate a day and time. Mom also shared that she is home all day and is not involved in a day program so she will be the primary caregiver for the patient.


Update:
Mom just called back and said her sister (maternal aunt) will be of better support to her as she's an RN and mom will feel more comfortable leaving the patient in her care if she had to. Both mom and aunt are available Saturday for a stay and teaching. SW shared that she will inform the team of this information.  


Plan: 
SW will continue to provide support and updates to DCPP.
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.
