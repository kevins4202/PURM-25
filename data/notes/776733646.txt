Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW called and spoke with Dad over the phone. Dad confirmed that he can attend a family meeting for Yaseen at 1pm. Dad located Dad's email address in a previous meeting invite: kal@veegalaxy.com.


SW sent Mom a photo of Yaseen's new haircut via MyCHOP. 


SW also received an email from Pennsdale Middle School RN Denise Bateson (dbateson@mciu.org) that Yaseen's classroom PCA has been assigned to another classroom since they do not have a discharge date for him at this time. School RN relayed that once they know when Yaseen is returning, they will reassign the PCA to his classroom. School RN asked about discharge updates. SW replied that there is still no discharge date at this time. SW agreed to keep School RN updated when we do have a discharge date so the school can arrange for Yaseen's return.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. 


Time Spent: 30 minutes
