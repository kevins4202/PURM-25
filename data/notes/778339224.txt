Progress:  LSW spoke with Leo's mother yesterday to provide support and assess needs. Leo's mother continues to cope as expected given the circumstances. LSW provided emotional support while speaking with the patient's mother. The patient's parents plan to come and visit on 2/10/23 and asked to speak about their insurance questions then. 


LSW spoke with both parents at the bedside today to provide education on applying for PA Medicaid if the parents decide to move to Pennsylvania. Parents were made aware that they should make their decision sooner rather than later as to not cause any insurance issues at the time of discharge. Parents were advised that they would need to call NJ Medicaid and terminate the plan only after becoming PA residence. Immediately after terminating NJ Medicaid, parents would need to apply for PA Medicaid. If parents were to become PA residents, FHC could assist with the PA Medicaid application. Parents did not have any questions at this time and verbalized their understanding of the information shared. 


Parents plan to stay to at the hospital this weekend to be with Leo. 


LSW helped to schedule the patient's mother meeting with Psychology next Friday at 11:30 am.


No immediate social work needs reported at this time.


Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.




Time Spent: 30 minutes
