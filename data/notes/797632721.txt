SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  Pt's mother was unable to come to bedside today for a meeting, so team had a phone call with her (Dr. Stewart, resident and SW). 
Discussed the following:
- Pt currently on .25L, will wean off tomorrow and monitor for one week, or put her back on oxygen if she shows she needs it. We will know oxygen plan by early next week
- Feeds currently running over one hour with a pump
- Teaching needed (GT, pump, +/- oxygen, medication) - then a stay is needed
- Pt could be ready to go home next week.


Mom reports she can probably stay overnight Friday into Saturday, but is unsure when else she can come in. She has to wait for her check in order to get transportation to bedside. (Mom reports she did not complete Colette Louise application for Uber credits).






Plan: Team will contact mom again tomorrow to clarify plan.




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
