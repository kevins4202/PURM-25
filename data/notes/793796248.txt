Progress: SW spoke with patient's mother over the phone as they were not at bedside. Mom reports that they have been sick for over a week but have been attempting to call more often. SW explained to patient's mother that the team would like to have a family meeting with them to go over the plan going forward. Mom reported that they are going to try and come this weekend and SW stated that it had to be during the week when everyone on the team could be present. Mom stated that dad has off every Monday so they could come in on Monday the 24th at 1:30 to meet with the team. SW inquired if they got the Harp's Hope cards left for them at bedside several weeks ago. Mom stated that they did and she attempted to use them but it did not work. Mom stated that she reached out to the organization who told them to try again but they have not. SW also encouraged mom to try it again as there has not been any problems previously using this organizations cards. Mom stated that she would and would let SW know if she runs into any other problems. Patient's mother had no other questions for SW at this time. 




Plan: SW will call patient's mother next week to confirm that the time for the family meeting is still ok. SW will also continue to follow and offer support.
