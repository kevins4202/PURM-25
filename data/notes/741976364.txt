Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress: SW met with patient's mother and grandmother who were present at bedside. Patient's mother reports that she spoke with Dr. McKenna yesterday and feels a lot better about the plan going forward and does not need a family meeting. Mom also reports that she spoke with SSI and has an appointment with them next week to begin that process. Patient's mother and grandmother had no other questions or concerns for SW at this time.  




Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 1 - Adequate resources to meet needs
