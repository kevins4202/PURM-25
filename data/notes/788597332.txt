SW and mom discussed coordinating a meeting with nursing leadership and PT about consistent care for Leandro's back and brace.  SW arranged meeting which took place away from bedside on 3/22.  At meeting a plan was discussed to create nursing sign out tool to eliminate inconsistencies in care and create bedside signs for diapering and bathing.
