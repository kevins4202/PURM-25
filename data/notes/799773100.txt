Detail the suspected child abuse or neglect to the child: King Kitchen is a 19 month old male who presented to CHOP ED on 05/09/23 after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Per report from King's mother, King and his siblings were left in the care of a maternal aunt, and King was found not breathing after being down for a nap. King was intubated on arrival to the ED and is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit in critical condition. His prognosis is unknown at this time. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a toddler with no known cause is highly unusual. Possible causes include toxic exposure, trauma, respiratory illness, cardiac illness, seizures, or infection. No cause for King's severe presentation has yet been identified, and he has no clinical findings or test results to suggest a natural cause at this time, though the workup is ongoing. Medical work up includes an evaluation of abuse and/or neglect as part of the differential diagnosis for King's out of hospital cardiac arrest. The exact circumstances leading up to Kingâ€™s presentation including supervision are unknown at this time and could be clarified through investigation. 





Detail any history or prior knowledge, if any, of child abuse or neglect to the child: Initial CHILDLINE report filed by CHOP ED SW but screened out due to lack of details. DHS requested new, near fatality report 




Details of additional actions taken:
