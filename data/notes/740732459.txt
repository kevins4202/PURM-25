SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient will have adequate transportation resources to access needed medical care and return to home environment
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  Mom asked SW if SW would be able to assist with mom to have transportation to the hospital.  SW re-explained due to the distance mom lives away from the hospital, SW would not be able to support routine visitation.  If patient had a critical meeting/ emergency then that would be doable but not ongoing.  SW advised mom to speak with DCP&P regarding this type of support.  Mom noted understanding and appreciated information.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.


Time Spent: 15 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
