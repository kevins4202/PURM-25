SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: RELATIONSHIPS/BEHAVIOR
Goal: Conflict between patient/family/caregiver is addressed and resolved
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  SW met with pt's mother at bedside to address reported verbal conflict between parents overnight. Mom reports that parents argued in the car on the way to CHOP and at bedside. She reports no safety concerns and that she feels comfortable visiting with pt's father and that a schedule is not needed at this time.


SW then met with both parents when father arrived.  SW explained that we cannot have arguments at bedside and that a visitation schedule will need to be made if parents cannot get along at bedside. Both parents acknowledged this and report no other needs.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
