Progress: SW spoke with patient's mother on the phone as mom was not at bedside. SW reported that she was leaving four meal vouchers for mom at bedside. SW also stated that she doesn't currently have any pack n plays but should have more once patient is ready for discharge. SW explained that if for some reason we do not have any, SW will provide mom with a gift card so she can purchase one. SW also let mom know that she heard from DHS worker Adrienne Redguard in regards to the current safety plan. SW explained that as grandmom has been identified as the safety plan, we will have her complete the training's/ CPR and videos as well as parents. SW stated that she was also told that MGM will need to be here at time of discharge as well. Mom reports that was not her understanding and MGM only needed to be at the house. SW encouraged mom to call her DHS worker for clarification. 




Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 1 - Adequate resources to meet needs
