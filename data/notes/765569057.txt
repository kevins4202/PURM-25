Team discussed baby's subgaleal hemorrhage and concern for potential bleeding issues.  Discussed time of delivery and difficulties.  Likely that baby did not have enough blood going to kidneys and need for aquadex as a bridge to attempt to give baby a chance to urinate and process fluid/ acid.  Parents asked adequate questions about procedure and expectations.  Hematology also suggested medication to assist with baby's bleeding complications.  Discussed potential that baby still may not survive this life saving attempt/ procedure as well as complications with aquadex machine if baby can't be on blood thinners initially.  Parents discussed together after meeting and noted wanting to move forward with aquadex as well as Kcentra medication/ provided consent.  Parents appreciated meeting and support.  SW provided gatorade, water bottles, snacks, and toiletries for parents overall coping and mom's struggle with post partum recovery.  SW also assisted parents with separate space away from bedside and coordinated approval with nurse managers for lifting limited visitors during critical time period.  Parents appreciated support.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
