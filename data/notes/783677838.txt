SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress: SW was asked to come to bedside as patient's mother had some questions. Patient's mother updated SW on how patient's surgery went on Monday and how they are all coping. Parents are still taking turns traveling each day to visit with patient. Mom inquired with SW about different financial resources that might be available to them. SW and mom had a long discussion about this and decided that we will start by applying to the Open Doors foundation. Patient's mother had no other questions or concerns for SW at this time.  




Plan: SW will work on filling out application as well as continue to provide support. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
