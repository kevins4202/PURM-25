SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  SW met with pt's mother at bedside throughout the day. Mom reports a supportive home environment for discharge. She will likely quit her job in anticipation of being pt's full time caregiver. SW reminded her of foundation assistance available for help with rent. SW provided mom with directions for how to take public transportation to bedside (although it would take an hour), Logisticare phone # (encouraged her to register pt, as she may be able to get rides to appts). and Community Resource Connects information. (Mom reports she sometimes borrow's grandmother's car, gets rides or takes Uber for twin's appts).
Mom plans to practice some care this evening and will return tomorrow for an overnight stay. Oxygen teaching still to be done; RN planned to contact CHHC. Mom asked about meal vouchers; SW provided 3 (one for tonight, 2 for wknd stay).




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
