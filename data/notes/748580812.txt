Progress:  SW spoke with mom via phone and text throughout the day.  Mom was unable to utilize Harps Hope card provided yesterday for transportation to mom's Virtua appointment for c-section infection and psychiatry support as well as assistance with completing adding baby to mom's NJ MA.  This was due to mom not having access to a checking account.  SW supported mom (as RMH was unable due to lack of funds) with a round trip Lyft ride from RMH to Virtua Voorhees.  Mom was able to be seen by her OB as well as meet with the social worker there.  She completed necessary submission of attestation of birth for her NJ MA application to the Burlington County Board of Social Services as well as referral for Psychiatry support via telehealth.  Mom appreciated support and was able to make it back to RMH safely.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
