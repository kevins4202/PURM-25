SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Progress:  SW intern met with parents by the bedside. Mother shared feelings on Dan's stay in the NI/ICU and how it has been balancing life between CHOP, being home in NY, and other life events. Mother disclosed that she was diagnosed with placenta choriocarcinoma and is receiving medical treatment in Boston. SW intern provided supportive counseling. Mother requested to receive medical updates after rounds as well as night. Due to current and upcoming holidays, Mother is unable to call in but is allowed to pick up the phone. SW intern coordinated with FLC and bedside nurse to accomodate this request. No other social work needs identified at this time. Parents are coping as well as to be expected.
