SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  Met with pt's mother at bedside this morning. Mom reports she will continue to receive housing assistance for the foreseeable future through NJ COVID funding, so does not need assistance. Mom continues to be on leave from work however and could use help with the cost of transportation. SW discussed the Colette Louise Foundation and e-mailed mom the link to complete the family portion of the application.
Mom is aware pt will likely be discharged with TPN. She has a 3 bedroom home that can accommodate shift nursing. We discussed identifying another caregiver; she will ask her sister or uncle.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
