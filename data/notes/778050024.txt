Progress:  LSW spoke with Gisselle's mother on the phone with the assistance of Spanish Interpretalk Interpreter. The patient's mother continues to cope well given the circumstances and is actively implementing strategies to promote healthy coping. LSW provided emotional support and brief supportive counseling while speaking with Gisselle's mother.


Gisselle's mother shared that the parents are prepared to reside in Philadelphia following Gisselle's discharge. Given the patient's premature birth, the parents' plans have changed and adapted based on Gisselle's medical needs. The patient's mother plans to return home to visit the patient's  brother once Gisselle is on less respiratory support and closer to discharge. The patient's mother demonstrated an understanding of Gisselle's ongoing medical needs and expressed excitement that Gisselle is doing well extubated.


The patient's mother has not had the opportunity to apply for SSI but plans to do so in the upcoming week.


Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
