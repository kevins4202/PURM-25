SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient will have adequate insurance coverage to obtain necessary medical care
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  SW received an email from Cynthia McKie in FHCP stating that mom has to fill out to two forms for each child and return those forms to her before she can submit the paperwork to Medicaid. SW called mom to confirm her email address so SW could email her the forms that need to be completed. SW encouraged mom to fill them out as soon as possible so FHCP can begin the process of getting insurance for patient. Mom stated that she would either email SW back or leave the documents under her office door. 




Plan: SW will follow up with patient's mother in the coming days about completing the paperwork. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
