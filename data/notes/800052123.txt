Progress: 
SW stopped by bedside while patient's mother was present. SW inquired whether mom was able to contact her insurance to see if patient is able to be added with the Proof of Birth letter. Mom said she has not yet called but will plan to do so today. In the interim, SW encouraged mom to remain in contact with the assigned FHPC coordinator so that in the event her primary won't allow her to add the patient, the FHPC coordinator can continue the process.

SW encouraged mom to reach out if any additional needs arise.
