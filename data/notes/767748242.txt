   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Baby Boy Tiesha Reddy
CHOP MRN#: 56917884
DOB:  11/11/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  12/23/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  9:54 AM


Problems: 
Discharge Planning


Progress:
SW was made aware that DHS nursing had questions in regards to home nursing so SW deferred it to Case Management.


SW called DHS worker Kelli Seibert to receive an update on the discharge plan. According to Kelli, DHS nursing is requesting a discharge planning meeting due to it being reported that aunt has some reservations with pateint's care because of her work schedule. Aunt has denied nursing and would only like nursing visits but DHS nursing believes it would be beneficial to have more frequent nursing. 


SW set up a virtual meeting via Teams for today at 11am and invited CHOP's medical team, DHS' team, and patient's family to discuss the plan for discharge. 
SW also call the CUA worker (Lisa Crump), as this information had just been provided by Kelli, in order to invite to the meeting. SW had no luck getting in contact with Lisa, but will still include her in the virtual invite via email.


Plan:
SW will continue to follow case and provide support for safe discharge. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
