SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress: SW met with patient's mother several times this past week. Mom reports that she has spoken with the director at Good Counsel and they are willing to accept her back at time of patient's discharge. SW encouraged mom to see if they would be willing to let mom use their address now so she can work on getting patient's insurance switched back to NJ instead of PA so there will not be any complications at time of discharged. On Thursday mom had a slight cough and sounded congested and this SW encouraged mom to take a break from bedside and go rest at RMH. Mom did leave the bedside at that time. SW and mom met this morning due to mom getting a phone call from SSI stating that they need records. Mom gave SW a contact number and asked her to call to follow up. SW called 732-258-5219 and left a voicemail for the SSI worker as they were not in the office.    




Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support. 




Time Spent: 120 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
