   PACT SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Girl A-Lashay Stevens
CHOP MRN#: 56912936
DOB:  10/31/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  3/23/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  8:56 PM


Problems: 
Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT members (MD Parikh, LSW Dombrowski) met with mother (Lashay) at bedside to provide ongoing support.  Lashay shared that they agreed with starting a new medication with neurology today - this has been hard to see her needing new medications but they are also hopeful it can help her.  Lashay is worried about how sleepy Aubree has been.  This is different from her baseline.  Lashay discussed her worry that Aubree could get sick again especially having a toddler age brother at home who is in school.  MD Parikh discussed things that the family might have to consider in the future if she were to get acutely ill again including the idea of a breathing tube.  


FAmily is hopeful Aubree can sprint respiratory support and work towards getting home.  It would be helpful for Lashay to identify goals and estimated time lines in terms of going home.  Lashay asked about additional continuity in terms of providers and we discussed the possibility of a continuity intensivist with PICU MD Fowler and PICU SW Weiss).  Father, Tahir, started his new job at the Navy Yard today.


Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with picu sw.


Time Spent: 45 minutes
