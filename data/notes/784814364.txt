SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress:  Covering LSW met with Camari's mother at the bedside to provide support and assess needs. The patient's mother is coping well given the circumstances and is able to articulate her thoughts and feelings related to Camari's ongoing hospitalization. The patient's mother was appropriately tearful when discussing the length of time Camari has been hospitalized. LSW provided supportive counseling and collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address stressors. 


No immediate social work needs identified at this time.




Plan: Covering LSW will provide support as needed this week.
