Additional Comments: 
SW consulted for support around visitation. Per report, biological father, Darius Gains, called last night (9/14/2022) requesting to visit patient at bedside. Request deferred until clarification around visitation was obtained from the current DCP&P team. SW spoke with Jillian Hauber (609-649-9666), DCP&P Supervisor, for clarification. Please note that father is not restricted, therefore stating he is authorized to visit Mason while hospitalized. SW unable to notify father due to no available contact information. Should father call, please obtain contact information and inform him that he is authorized to visit. Per report from SCAN, mother is not in agreement with father being present at bedside due to limited interaction with Mason. Mother made aware that by law, father has the right to visit. In the event that parents are unable to coexist without confrontation at bedside, SW will move forward with creating a schedule allowing each parent 12 hours at bedside with Mason independently.


SW will continue to follow along SCAN colleagues, providing support as needed.
