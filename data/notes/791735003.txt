SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  Virtual family meeting held this afternoon with parents, pt's aunt Melissa, CUA worker (Shonse Hawkins), DHS RN (Alita Thompson), Dr. Chua, CM, SW, clinical supr and bedside nurse.
Discussed the following:
- Provided an overview of pt's medical issues (CLD, feeding difficulties, ASD, ventricles in the brain are small, ROP, hemangioma on back). 
- Oxygen wean schedule as tolerated (wean to 1L this Sat, then .5L the following Saturday, then off). Discussed reasoning for this timing/schedule and explained that pt will not grow well if weaned too quickly; pt may need oxygen at home.
- Current feeding plan is 24kcal formula every 3 hours. SLP evaluated pt and she is safe for paci dips only, oral skills are delayed. Discussed NGT vs GT.
- Orthopedics does not recommend surgical intervention on pt's foot at this time.
- Teaching will be provided for whatever equipment she is discharged with. Discussed that maternal aunt and MGM would attend class in the Family Learning Center; parents will be taught at bedside.Aunt will do a 12 or 24 hour stay, depending on pt's needs. Aunt expressed that she would be comfortable caring for pt with equipment.
- Discharge could be the first week in May.
Dad's questions were answered. Will plan for parents to receive some bedside education about GT from the unit mannequin when they are here next and will make a decision next week. Offered for parents to meet with SLP as well. 




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
