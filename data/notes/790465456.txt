SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  Gisselle's father was present for medical rounds today and a VRI Spanish Interpreter was utilized to facilitate communication. The medical team provided the patient's father with an overall plan of care update and Dr. Callaway stated that it is highly unlikely that Gisselle will need a tracheotomy. The patient's father demonstrated understanding and asked appropriate questions. 


With a VRI Spanish Interpreter, LSW met with Gisselle's father at the bedside while he held and soothed the patient following medical rounds. The patient's father shared that parents were hopeful Gisselle would not need a tracheostomy and hearing the medical update today was reassuring. 


The patient's mother plans to travel to Mexico in the coming weeks to be with Gisselle's brother prior to the patient's discharge. Parents will inform social work and the medical team once the plans have been finalized. 


The patient's mother received two medical bills. LSW provided the patient's mother with guidance on how to proceed. LSW will continue to provide support and has offered to call with the patient's mother if needed.


Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 


Time Spent: 90 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
