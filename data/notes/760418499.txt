Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: 
SW checked in with patient's parents at bedside. Both mom and dad were frustrated with patient still being here at the hospital. Mom does not want the patient's first Thanksgiving to be here and she wants to be able to spend it home with family. Mom shared that she is already upset that patient's first Halloween was here in the hospital. Dad shared it's frustrating when he see other families leave and they are still here. SW validated both mom and dad's feelings, as being here at the hospital during a child's first can be hard to deal with, but SW ensured parents that it will not be the patient's last holiday and they will be able to make memories beyond being here at the hospital. SW encouraged family to take it day by day and to not compare the patient's progress with anyone in the hospital. Everyone moves at their own pace.
After talking for a bit, SW asked if there was anything in addition the family may need and the parents shared meal vouchers would be appreciated. Other than that, parents shared they are not in need of anything else. 
SW encouraged family to reach out if they need to talk or if there are any additional needs.


Plan:
Continue to follow up with family while on the ITCU
Submit for meal vouchers.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
