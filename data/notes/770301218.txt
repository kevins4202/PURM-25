LSW spoke with Leo's father on the phone who expressed the same desire for parents to visit together. 


LSW and Nurse Manger, Kameela Miller, met with Leo's mother at the bedside to reinforce behavior expectations and inform mom that the visitation schedule has been removed. Leo's mom shared her appreciation and verbalized her understanding of the expectations.
