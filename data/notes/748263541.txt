SW called mom to introduce social work and discuss role and offer support. 


Mom was inquiring about visitation with four year old sibling and places to stay close to the hospital. Mom reports family car is currently not working but should be fixed soon (next day or so). 


SW provided mom with link to request room form RMH and explained visitation current on policy.
