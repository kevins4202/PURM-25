SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress: SW spoke with patient's mother several times throughout the day to help coordinate a way for them to visit with patient this weekend. Patient's mother reported that she is interested in staying at the RMH but if that is not available then she would like to stay in a sleep room. When asked who else would be coming mom stated that patient's father and her children would most likely come. SW reminded patient's mother that children are not allowed to stay in sleep rooms but they are welcome at the RMH. After several more phone calls between the RMH and mom, it was decided that parents are not allowed to stay at RMH. SW called mom back one last time to see if they would still be interested in staying in a sleep room but mom did not answer. SW left a message asking for a return call.   




Plan: SW will sign this out to ongoing SW who will follow up with mom next week. 




Time Spent: 150 minutes
