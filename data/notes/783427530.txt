Savannah is a 14 yo girl with severe aplastic anemia admitted to CHOP for bone marrow transplant.  PACT is consulted for longitudinal support and symptom management.  PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Walter, MD Maitra) met with Savannah and her mother (Stephanie) at bedside to introduce the role of PACT, assess needs and provide support.  Savannah and Stephanie shared the course since diagnosis and the many complications that Savannah has experienced.  Savannah was able to share in detail about her pain which has been longstanding.  Savannah and Stephanie expressed that the times when Savannah's pain has been well managed, she is able to be active up and out of bed, participating in art, movie nights etc.  Stephanie worries that Savannah isn't herself because of her level of discomfort.  They are expecting to be moved to the oncology floor on Sunday to prepare for bone marrow transplant.  They worry about what she will experience in transplant but are hopeful that transplant will work so that they can get back home and focus on enjoying life.  It has been extremely hard to be separated as a family.


Savannah lives with her parents and older brother (Samuel) who is a senior in high school.  Savannah is in the 8th grade but unfortunately hasn't been able to attend school in person due to her lengthy hosptilization.  Savannah's mother is a case manager and a behavioral health nurse and is currently on FMLA leave.  Father also works full time.  It has been understandably difficult for the family adjusting to Philadelphia and a new hospital system. They are hopeful father and brother will visit this weekend.  Mother is currently staying at the Ronald McDonald House.
