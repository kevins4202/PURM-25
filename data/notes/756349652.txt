 The Children's Hospital 
of Philadelphia 



   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Jordan Neitz
CHOP MRN#: 56911357
DOB:  10/12/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  11/2/2022
TODAY'S TIME:  3:46 PM


Problems: 
Hospital discharge and Placement, custody/consent, Virginia CPS involvement and Bucks County CYS.


Progress: Ongoing. This SW contacted VA CPS Intake, Breanna Miller, 757-719-6429, who reported that the plan for having the patient discharged to the Maternal Uncle, Sam Neitz and his wife, is still the most likely plan for disposition, however, VA CPS is waiting on the courtesy home visit to the Uncle's home by the Buck County CPS Social Worker, Ashley Foley, 267-227-2195, for clearance of the physical home setting and assessment of the Uncle and his wife. This SW met the Uncle's wife at the bedside, she has been visiting the patient for several hours. SW was informed that the Uncle and she have 2 young toddlers at home, she is a homemaker while the Uncle works full-time. The Maternal Aunt had a copy of the POA to the Uncle with the mother's signature. It was still be advisable that we obtain telephone consents from the biological mother if she is available for release of the patient when medically cleared since the mother is still the legal guardian and the POA papers here in Pa, as well as the particular paperwork as presented may not be enough for clearance without the mother's consent. 


This SW contacted the Bucks County CYS SW, Ms. Foley, who reported that she is planning to visit the Uncle and Aunt's home tomorrow around 3:30pm. Ms. Foley will communicate her impression of the Uncle's home and the family to VA CPS.  


Plan:  SW will follow closely in collaboration with VA CPS and Bucks County CYS for a safe discharge plan.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
