Additional comments:  


Father requested to speak with on call SW about Greyhound Bus tickets. SW spoke to father via phone who stated that his car broke down and he would like to travel home to Allentown today to help his wife with the car. He reports financial stress at this time and does not have the money for a bus ticket. Dad advised to follow up with unit SW about any additional resources moving forward.
