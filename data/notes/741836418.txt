Progress:  SW spoke with mom and DCP&P today to attempt to coordinate family meeting next week to discuss MRI results with Neurology team.  Mom noted that the information she received from the initial results was "scary" and she was unclear why she needed to come into the hospital to discuss results again.  SW provided emotional support and explained best practice and results more in detail; also opportunity for mom to hold baby for first time.  Mom said she also had to explain this to FOB and assumed he would be coming to the hospital with her for meeting which would also be a new dynamic for all involved.  Mom noted she was actively at the doctor's office for prenatal care.  Mom noted through discussion that she felt best to still come in physically for family meeting with team. DCP&P noted they could coordinate transportation for mom on Tuesday 8/30 and also ensured care of her 5yo with MGM.  SW acknowledged need to confirm timing with Neurology and confirm back with DCP&P and mom tomorrow.  Mom appreciated support.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
