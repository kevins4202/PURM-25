Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT is familiar with Carey and her family.  Her mother (Dang) requested to re-engage with our team while she was visiting here from Vietnam.  PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Walter)  Dang expressed that Carey has been doing well which she is comforted with but she will soon be discharged to a long term care facility.  This is understandably a difficult transition for the family after being here at CHOP for some time.  Dang had questions about whether there were any additional options for her daughter and recognizes that the location of the facility may be hard for them to get to when they are able to visit from Vietnam.  She also relayed that in Vietnam, people with tracheostomies don't live out of the hospital setting.  We normalized that patients here in the United States can live in a long term care facility outside of the hospital when home with nursing is not a possibility.  In discussion with Dang, she shared that she has already communicated with the facility that a transfer to the Philadelphia location if a bed were to open up would be preferred for the family.  Dang expressed that she didn't have any other current needs for PACT at this time.


Plan: PACT will sign off but can be called back in if needed.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
