SW and mom discussed Melody's eventual discharge and possible move to the ITCU step down unit for parent teaching.  Mom expressed excitement at the idea of Melody eventually coming home.  Mom reported that she and dad do not yet have a crib or bassinet for Melody and that she plans to go to Walmart before Melody's discharge to purchase one.  SW offered mom a pack and play and mom declined.  Mom discussed purchasing clothes and diapers at Walmart nearer to time of discharge.  Mom reported that she has WIC and plans to call to set up appointment when Melody is discharged.  Mom also reported applying for SSI for Melody.  SW inquired about a pediatrician for Melody.
