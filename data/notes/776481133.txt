Progress: Family meeting held with Mother (Hebatella), Father (Kaled) via video, Complex Care and PACT.  Prior to this meeting, parents discussed with ENT and Pulmonary teams details about tracheostomy in detail as well as the possibility of a septoplasty.  Both parents felt that this detailed information had been helpful to them.  Father expressed concern that a tracheostomy would not be tolerated by his son and not the right path for him.  Team discussed medication management with the parents and the current wean of clonidine given that they didn't think it help Yaseen.  Teams expressed that medications are a delicate balance as there is concern it could further decrease his muscle tone.  Mother expressed the importance of knowing and thinking through plans going forward given all of Yaseen's care needs and the other things she is managing at home being a single caregiver.  She wants to make decisions that keep Yaseen safe, allow him to have a childhood, and be happy and comfortable at home with his family.
