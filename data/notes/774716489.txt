Yaseen is a 14 yo male with history of congenital abnormalities likely secondary to genetic condition, dysgenesis of the corpus collosum, spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, blindness and hearing loss, admitted for titration of respiratory support.  PACT was consulted for longitudinal support and goals of care discussions. 


Family meeting held with mother (in person), father (via video), Complex Care, Pulmonary, PACT and Arabic Interpreter.  Medical teams shared an update about Yaseen's status and current care needs and concern for his overall worsening.  Given his inability to tolerate bipap and due to the location of his obstruction, the only medical intervention that would considered is a tracheostomy.  Both the medical teams and family have concerns about Yaseen's ability to tolerate tracheostomy and worry that he would pull it out.  Yaseen's mother is also worried about her ability to care for him at home given that she is his solo care provider.  Father confirmed that due to work, he is unable to provide physical care for Yaseen.  


Parents appropriately have additional questions about tracheostomy and also what care moving forward would look like for Yaseen if they chose not to pursue that option.


PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Mejie, DO Robinson) met with mother following the meeting to be able to more fully introduce the role of PACT, assess needs and provide support.  Mother (Hebatalla) shared how hard she works to care for all of her children but also acknowledge how difficult this can be.  She does not have others here that support her as her extended family is in Morocco.  She is connected with her local mosque who is able to provide some food resources and confirmed food insecurity.  She works remotely when she is able.  Father is working full time.  Yaseen has a 17 yo brother (Bilal) and 10 yo sister (Yara).  Bilal is currently applying to colleges to study psychology.  Father is currently living in North Carolina.  Both parents share legal custody and medical decision making.  Family's first language is Arabic and an interpreter should be used for discussions.
