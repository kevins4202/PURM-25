   PACT SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Girl A-Lashay Stevens
CHOP MRN#: 56912936
DOB:  10/31/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  6/1/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  9:52 PM


Problems: 
Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT members (CRNP Nelson, LSW dombrowski) met with Mother (Lashay) at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Family is working on training for tracheostomy care.  Lashay shared that Aubree has been quite stiff recently and she worries about that.  She also shared that because their home failed inspection, she is now having to consider facility placement prior to transfer home as she looks for alternate housing.  This is understandably a disappointment for her as they so greatly want to be home together as a family as soon as safely possible.


Plan: PACT will remain available for support and can be contacted at any time.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
