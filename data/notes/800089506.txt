SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  SW received a text from pt's mother yesterday that her ride didn't work out and she was not able to come in. She reported that she rescheduled class and requested assistance with transportation for her and dad for today at 5:00. SW replied to her this morning with some questions and notified her of oxygen teaching at 12:30. Mom then called SW to say she was not aware of any teaching at 12:30 today.


SW spoke to mom further with bedside nurse and charge nurse to make plan for necessary teaching/training in anticipation of discharge next week. Mom reported she could come to bedside tomorrow from 1 - 9. Nursing offered to try to schedule GT class in the Family Learning Center for the afternoon. SW offered to contact CHHC to see if pump teaching could also occur tomorrow. It is ok for mom to do a stay this weekend before oxygen teaching, so we will see of oxygen teaching can be done on Monday in anticipation of possible discharge Tuesday. Mom indicated she would have to see about a ride. In an effort to ensure mom can be at bedside the full amount of time needed for education, SW will approve a Lyft ride for her, but will need to discuss other options for future trips back to CHOP. 




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
