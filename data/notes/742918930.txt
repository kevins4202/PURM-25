Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  SW met mom and approved supervisor for mom's visitation MGF (James Pleiss) at bedside today.  Mom and MGF were appropriate.  SW discussed available supports and MGF noted he has been paying $16 for parking to bring mom as well as the cost of gas for 2 hour car ride both ways.  SW provided MGF with a Harps Hope card for gas assistance as well as 1 parking pass.  SW also facilitated approval with charge nurse for MGF to get caregiver badge as he brings mom the most to have access to parent parking discount.  Mom was aware she is not able to have a parent badge as for the visitor restriction in place requiring her to be supervised.  Mom was able to be set up with MyChart today via admissions.  Family appreciated support.


After family left, CYS case worker came to bedside to see the baby to complete routine visit as well as received general update from bedside nurse.  


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.


Time Spent: 90 minutes
