SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  LSW met with Jeremy's mother at the bedside to offer support. The patient's mother articulated her thoughts and feelings related to the patient's ongoing hospitalization. Jeremy's mother identified that she has increased anxiety when the medical team informs her of possible interventions that may be needed for the patient. LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to identify strategies to help with reducing her anxiety and worry. Additionally, mom will call dad when a medical update is being provided so that both parents can hear the update together. 


Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
