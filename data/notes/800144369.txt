SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress: SW met with patient's mother and father who were present at bedside. SW informed mom that she got her e-mail and unfortunately they do not qualify for that foundation as neither of them are working at this time. SW stated that she is still looking for financial help and will let her know as soon as she finds one. Mom also reported that she is still having issues and coming up against a lot of barriers with adding patient to her insurance. SW made a referral to FHCP to see if there is anything they can help assist mom with getting patient added as he is now 30 days old. SW provided emotional support and plans to meet with mom again in the coming days.   




Plan: SW will continue to follow and offer support. 




Time Spent: 90 minutes
Acuity: Level 4 - Require significant advocacy to meet basic needs
