SW called Dad with a Haitian Creole Interpreter (ID# 257323). Dad shared that the family was driven by a social worker to a hotel, where they are staying until SW comes back for them to take them to the identified home. Dad reports he did not have a name or phone number for that social worker and is awaiting for her to come back for the family. Dad believes it will take her a few days to find somewhere and come back for them.


SW advised Dad to call SW as soon as they are set up in a place. SW also asked that Dad take down the name and phone number of the SW helping them when she comes back so SW can speak with her. Dad in agreement. SW advised that Dad call SW if this happens today. SW provided the 3ESCH Unit Number if the SW comes back over the weekend and told Dad to call the unit. Dad in agreement.
