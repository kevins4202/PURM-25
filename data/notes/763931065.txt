Progress: 
SW met at bedside and maternal grandmom, dad, and paternal grandmom was present. SW talked with dad to see if he had been in touch with DHS worker Kelli Seibert, as she has been trying to get in touch with him in regards to custody for the patient. SW provided the number to dad to call.


SW followed up with Kelli to let her know that dad should be contacting here soon. Kelli inquired about dad and SW said that she could go back on the unit for her to talk to dad. Kelli mentioned that maternal aunt, Latifah Reddy, would be next to take in the patient if dad is not suitable. Kelli provided the contact number to SW.


SW went back to the floor and had Kelli on the line for dad to talk to. Kelli then wanted to talk to paternal grandmother for information. When it came time to talk to maternal grandmother, Kelli disconnected the call. SW called back and she did not answer.


Patient's mom contact SW with confusion on why patient is not allowed home with her after her home was inspected and SW informed mom that the decision is not made by SW, but instead her DHS workers. SW will follow up with Kelli tomorrow to receive and update.


Plan:
SW will follow up with Kelli and her supervisor Julian Johnston.
