Plan: SW participated in family meeting with Javier's Mom and MGM, CICU care team, and Heart Failure team.  Family was provided with a medical update and seemed to understand Javier's condition. Heart Failure then introduce the idea/conept of VAD and heart transplant.  Care teams explained that Javier's stay in the hospital could be months and prepared family for long duration.  Family asked appropriate questions to get clarifying information.  Family wishes to do everything possible to take Javier home.  SW provided emotional support and continued to assess for needs.  Family asked if MGM could be provided second parent badge as no father has been identified.  This was approved and family was notified, this will allow MGM to switch off and on with Mom so she can take breaks.  If father should present himself, CICU leadership and family will have to revisit this.  Local accomodation continue to be discussed as Mom is not eligible for RMH due to her age and no support has been identified to be with Mom during her stay.  Sleeps have been provided since admission.  SW provided addiitonal meal vouchers to help family with finances.  SW welcomed family to contact him if additional support/resources are needed.
