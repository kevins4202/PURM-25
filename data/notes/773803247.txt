Progress:  SW received a call from FOB as he was lost in the Family Court Building attempting to present advocacy letter to Domestic Relations.  SW worked with DHS Case worker via phone to provide FOB direction as he was repeatedly redirected to several incorrect floors/ departments.  When FOB was at Domestic Relations, FOB put SW on the phone with Marco Capone, Clerk of Family Courts who noted that FOB was having significant difficulty explaining purpose for advocacy and that they couldn't find the child in the system.  SW sent secure email with DHS case worker to Mr. Capone including the letter FOB brought to office (in letters section), along with two images of confirmation of Intake Interview/ custody transfer date of 3/7.  Mr. Capone was unable to find direction for SW, DHS Casworker, and FOB in how to expedite moving up the 3/7 date.  DHS Case worker noted she would consult DHS attorney and supervisor for assistance at this time.  SW notified supervisor as well.  SW met with FOB at bedside and provided support noting to follow up with him when DHS is able to provide further guidance.  FOB appreciated support.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
