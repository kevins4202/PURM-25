Progress:  LSW reached out to Roman's mother via phone and text message to follow up on the  G-tube and Trach training requirements. LSW spoke with Roman's great grandmother to ask that Roman's mother give LSW a call back. Mom was not home at the time and her phone is currently broken. LSW attempted to reach the patient's mother several times throughout the day.


LSW spoke with Roman's grandmother to inquire about the missed G-tube class on 1/28/23. The grandmother was not feeling well on Saturday and was unable to attend. LSW reinforced the importance of the family calling the bedside nurse or the learning center to reschedule the class. If Roman's grandmother is feeling better tomorrow, she plans to visit and begin bedside training. LSW reinforced the expectations for training and emphasized the importance of coming in regularly when their schedule allows.


The home inspection was completed on 1/25/23 and the family scheduled a nursing agency interview at the bedside for Thursday. 


LSW spoke with DHS case worker Felicia Harrison (267-242-7951) to provide an update on the mother and grandmother's training progress. LSW informed the case worker that Roman's mother and grandmother did not attend the G-tube class scheduled for 1/23 and 1/28. As of 1/30/23, the family has not begun training. At the request of the case worker, LSW followed up via email summarizing the training update. 




Plan: LSW will continue to assess and provide support.
