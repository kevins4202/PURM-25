Progress: SW spent time with mother at the bedside for check in and to provide supportive counseling. Mom will be leaving next week to take patient's sibling back to Vietnam. She plans to be gone for a few weeks and will return to PA. Parents will move back to Vietnam in February. 


Parents declined referral to Pittsburgh facility and would like patient to be placed in a facility closer to Philadelphia. Dad will be returning to Philadelphia in the future to finish his studies and a facility closer to Philadelphia will allow them to visit patient more frequently. Mom stated that the family was exploring other options such as California but transferring patient there may not be feasible due to insurance issues and lack of residency in CA. Mom reports that her husband has family there who could check on patient if patient was placed in facility in California.
