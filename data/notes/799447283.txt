Progress:
SW stopped by bedside while patient's mom and dad were present to check in. SW utilized spanish interpreter 702546.

Mom inquired whether SW was in contact with the immigration lawyer Mana (267-807-9396), in which SW had not been. Mom shared their extension is set to expire in July, so she wants to make sure that they are in good standing and want to make sure the lawyer has all the information she will need in regards to the patient's medical plan and needs.
