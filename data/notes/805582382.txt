Mom is currently unemployed and Dad is employed as a cook.  Farrow has active insurance with NJ MA/Horizon NJ Health.  Mom plans on staying bedside while Dad remains home to work.  Family is without a car and transportation might be needed.  SW spoke with Mom about reimbursing a friend/family member if transportation is provided by them.  Lyft/Ubers are reserved for emergencies. Family has been placed on wait list for a room at RMH.  


SW explained his role and how he could assist the family.  Family resource guide and visitor policy were reviewed.
