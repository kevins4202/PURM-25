Progress:
SW, Onco Attending, Cardiology FLC, Spanish Interpreter and Mom were in attendance for family meeting. Medical updates were provided and additional information on next steps with the care plan. Mom asked clarification questions in regards to care and follow up. 


It had been shared that parents have a home to go to at the time of discharge, but the long term goal will be obtaining their own housing and the patient's father obtaining the job. Outpatient Cardiology SW has been assisting and connecting the family with resources in their area and will plan to follow at the time of discharge.
