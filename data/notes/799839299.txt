Progress:  LSW met with Bentley's parents and maternal grandmother at the bedside to introduce purple team social worker. Parents live an hour and half from CHOP and are eligible to stay at RMD house. Parents will check into RMD house today. 


LSW provided an overview of the visitation policy and answered all questions. The patient's parents demonstrated understanding and were appropriately disappointed that no more than two additional visitors could visit within a two week period. 


LSW provided supportive counseling while meeting with Bentley's parents. The patient's parents shared their birth experience and the emotions surrounding the traumatic experience. 
Parents were appropriately tearful when reflecting on their NICU journey so far.


LSW will meet with the patient's parents tomorrow to complete the social work assessment.
