SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress: Covering LSW met with Ahron's mother at the bedside to provide support and assess needs. The patient's mother is coping as expected given the circumstances and is able to articulate her thoughts and feelings. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with Ahron's mother. 


The patient's mother does not have Internet access at home and is unable to access the Angel Eye. Covering LSW reached out to Naomi Stavsky at Chai Lifeline on 2/10/23 to see if the agency had resources for the patient's mother to assist with access. LSW followed up today with Naomi and she plans to reach out to the family directly. 




Plan: Covering social worker will continue to follow and provide support.
