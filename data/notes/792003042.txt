Plan: SW discussed teaching concerns with edu RN and ISVMP program lead today, also coordinated with cardiac psychologist regarding recommendations and potential ID evaluation next week. 


Checked in with parents and PGM at bedside, parents report no questions/concerns with education today or plan of care, did not name any aspects of teaching that were particularly easy or challenging. SW discussed potential for 12 hour stay next week and parents stated they would be able to attend anytime, mom is unemployed and dad's work schedule is flexible. PGM is pharmacist and peripherally involved, came today as general support for family. 


SW does note some concern for limited response to education/care given complexity of child's needs and difficulties with aspects of care per RN team. Will continue to work with RN, medical team, and psychology to best support family given learning limitations for best success in home setting. 


SW will continue to follow the family.
