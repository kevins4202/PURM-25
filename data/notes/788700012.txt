Progress: 


SW met with mom at bedside on Tuesday to assess ongoing coping and provide support as needed. Mom appeared to be coping well and shared that her son who just discharged home from PCU after over 1 year is transitioning well to home. Mom shared that the family has received much home nursing support to assist in the transition. Mom acknowledged that the family has been very busy at home which has impacted hospital visitation, however family continues to call in for updates regularly. Family appreciates us calling for larger updates as well.


SW assessed insurance status. Mom shared that she anticipates the baby being covered under her plan for first 30 days, then is applying for CHIP or MA through CHOP's Family Health Coverage Program. SW encouraged mom to call into her insurance to confirm baby is covered for that period of time. Mom shared that she has not submitted documents to FHCP but will do so as soon as possible. SW welcomed mom to reach out if needing any additional support. SW provided these updates to case management. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow and provide support.
