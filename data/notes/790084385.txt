PT was brought to the ED via ambulance after mom found her unresponsive this morning in her bed. Mom reports that PT was found yesterday 3/29/23 "wondering around" at 55th and Haverford. When located by her brother, PT got into brother's car, was brought home, and then went to sleep around 8:30pm last night. Mom then attempted to get PT up this morning and she was not responsive and then 911 was contacted. 


It was first though that PT possibly ingested something, however, based upon medical workup, it does appear that her ED admission was related to onset of Type 1 Diabetes. Mom reported that she has Type 1 Diabetes and that the PT has been urinating and drinking a lot of water for over the past year Mom reported that recently PT's PCP was consulted due to her being tired and it was thought that this was related to allergies, for which the PT was prescribed a non-drowsy OTC Claritin.


SW met with PICU SW along with mom and provided a brief update to PICU SW.
