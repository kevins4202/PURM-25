SOCIAL WORK NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Baby Girl Karolina Walker
CHOP MRN#: 56979300
DOB:  4/5/2023
TODAY'S DATE:  6/8/2023
TODAY'S TIME: 8:28 AM


Social work continues to follow this patient.  


Additional Comments: SW spoke to York County CYS worker Ashley Althoff (717-309-5324). SW confirmed that court documentation stating York County CYS has consenting rights for patient is uploaded into chart. 


This includes documentation uploaded on 6/2 stating that transfer for jurisdiction from Lancaster County to York County was granted; placing patient in the custody of York County CYS and allowing York county caseworker Ashley Althoff or York County CYS on-call staff (for after business hours) to consent to medical procedures. 


SW also explained that nursing staff has reported that patient's father has been calling the unit asking to visit patient and stating he has been unable to reach CYS. Ashley reports that she previosuly made father aware that he cannot visit unsupervised and that CYS scheduled supervised visits the first of which will take place 6/12. Ashley confirmed father is aware a scheduled supervised visit is planned 6/12 but it is unlikely patient will still be admitted at this point due to CYS being hopeful to identify placement by end of this week. SW requested Ashley reach out to father to address his concerns and reiterate visitor restriction.


After speaking with CYS, SW attempted to contact patient's father, Mitchell Walther, and left a voicemail requesting a call back. 


SW remains available as needed.
