SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing



Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient household finances will support family/caregiver(s) presence to participate in patient care and transition patient home
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  Social worker spoke with mother by phone to check-in and offer support. Mother shared that she is overall coping well at this time. Transportation expenses remain a source of financial resource strain given Everly's lengthy hospitalization, and her older sister's lengthy hospitalization earlier this year. Family was approved for financial assistance through the Opens Doors Foundation earlier this year and thus will not be eligible for assistance again for another 12 months from their application date. Discussed applying to the Colette Louise Tisdahl Foundation when applications reopen on 1/4/23. Mother has not yet begun the SSI application process, and plans to do so. No other immediate social work needs identified. 




Plan: Social worker will continue to follow. 




Time Spent: 15 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
