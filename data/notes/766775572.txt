Insurance


Progress: 
SW contacted mom via phone after receiving an email from Prior Auth that patient is still not active on insurance. SW let mom know of this finding and advised both her and/or dad to give a call to the insurance company to check on this, especially since the patient's discharge is approaching soon. Mom shared that when they logged on, that patient had been listed, but SW asked her to call the insurance company to make sure the coverage starts from the day he was born. SW also provided mom with a Proof of Birth letter via email so that she and/or dad can provide this information to her insurance company.  


Plan:
SW will continue to follow up on this matter as well as provide support to both patient and family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 15 minutes
