Aubree is a 4 month old baby girl with history of severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy secondary to perinatal cardiac arrest in the setting of umbilical cord compression.  PACT was consulted for longitudinal and decision making support.  See initial PACT consult note (3/9/23).  PACT members (MD Mejia, DO Johnson, LSW Dombrowski) met with father (Tahir) at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Mother was present but sleeping at the time of our visit.  Tahir shared that Aubree has been tolerating sprints well and the plan is to increase them today.  He is hopeful she will continue to do well with this so they can transfer out of the PICU and work on getting home.  Tahir shared that Aubree is seeming more stiff and he is wondering if this might be her botox wearing off.   Parents are navigating back and forth to the hospital with Aubree's twin sister Addison.  They are playing music at bedside made by family.


Aubree's family (parents, twin sister Addison and 2 yo  Brother TK) in Philadelphia.
