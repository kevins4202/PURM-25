TODAY'S DATE:  3/17/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  11:45 AM


Problems: 
VISA Support


Progress:
SW made contact with RMH SW, Sari Sosnick, to obtain an update from the conversation with the family's immigration attorney and to see if there was anything needed from SW. 


RMH SW spoke with the lawyer, Mana, yesterday. From when the family originally applied for their visa extension, RMH provided a length of stay letter. Immigration is requesting more evidence for the case of approving the visa, so Mana is looking to make the length of stay letter a little more detailed from RMH end to provide as evidence.


At this time, there are no SW needs in regards to immigration visa support.As RMH continues to work with Mana, RMH will keep SW updated as well.


Plan: 
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 1 - Adequate resources to meet needs
