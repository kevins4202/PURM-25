PICU SW met with Step grandmother bedside. She visits a lot @ Pediamanor.  MGF is also involved and they are no longer together but are involved in Joseph's care.


Grandmother is a licence therapist but in transition and money is tight.  PICU SW approved meal vouchers for this admission. Overall coping well and PICU SW will meet with Maternal Grandmother too.


PICU SW will continue to provide support.
