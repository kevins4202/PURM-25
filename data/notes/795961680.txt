SW had collaborated with HUP SW upon baby's admission last week as mom remained inpatient with unanticipated discharge at least into week of 4/24.  Mom was discharged to home on Friday 4/21 and asked to come into hospital for baby's discharge planned for today 4/24.  Due to change in surgical plan/ morphine wean/ and in the setting of mom's current inability to be mobile for basic needs without assistance/ support.  Team changed discharge to tomorrow 4/25.  Mom was verbally upset with plan in discussion with Fellow and noted strong distrust in medical team both at HUP and CHOP.  SW came to assess mom during escalated conversation at bedside and acknowledged mom's request for space prior to meeting with SW.  SW returned and mom was calm however very tires and in obvious pain.  Mom noted that she had been through extreme circumstances to have baby and did not feel comfortable with the care she received at HUP.  Mom noted she had pain medication at home but not physically with her as she thought baby was being discharged to her today.  SW acknowledged need for mom to have support present with her at the hospital as she will need support at home to care for herself and the baby.  SW noted if transportation was the main issue between childcare for her 5yo and 1yo and scheduling, SW would request a Lyft to get maternal aunt to hospital and to get both her, mom, and baby home as well.  Mom agreed to this plan.  SW also noted to continue to collaborate with HUP SW for mom's mental health support and SSI application for herself/ baby's insurance.  SW also provided 4 meal vouchers, toiletries, and snacks upon setting of mom planning to spend the night.  Mom also received information for PCP  CHOP 3550 Market St. For baby's follow up appointment. 


At approx. 6pm SW followed up with mom at bedside as mom had declined with her pain and ability to get to the bathroom without significant nursing support.  MGM asked for a charge nurse to contact her immediately as mom was told team would have to call a code if mom needed emergent support/ potentially readmitted to HUP.  MGM felt that CHOP staff should be able to treat/ support mom.  Charge nurse was able to provide education to MGM regarding adult vs. Child hospitalization/ care support available and emergent process.  SW sat with mom who was very frustrated with current pain/ status/ and not wanting to go back to HUP.  Mom asked SW to call her a Lyft to get home however team was not comfortable doing so without a family member present to assist/ be with mom.  Mom was open to going home for the night and nursing was able to activate her Angel Eye camera.  Mom was tearful and SW provided emotional support.  SW also approved round trip Lyft for sister to be present at hospital and to assist mom home.  SW noted to reevaluate with family for d/c tomorrow.  Mom appreciated support and was in a stable state for plan upon SW leaving for the night.
