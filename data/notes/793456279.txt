Progress: SW met with Maternal Aunt at the bedside. Maternal Aunt informed SW that Mom received a call from her insurance this morning that she will need to pay $2000 up front for the surgery. Mom was very upset and overwhelmed, as she needs this surgery tomorrow and does not have $2000. SW and Mom communicated with the surgery office throughout the day. The surgery is now fully covered with no out of pocket cost. Mom expressed tremendous relief and gratitude.


Mom shared that she was successful in filing her taxes today and received all of the needed forms for her SSI application. Mom will bring them in on Monday to complete with SW. 


Mom was on her way to Salvation Army to pick up a chair for the home nurse to sit in while caring for Yaribeth. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow.
