Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Kataleyah Colon 
Date of Birth:  8/21/2022 
MRN:  56883192


Progress: SW visited the bedside to introduce self and SW support on 8S. Mom confirmed she is familiar with SW support from the PICU.


Mom shared that she spoke with insurance and they will not send her an insurance card for Kataleyah until 12/1. Mom reports that the PCP in North Philly who see her other children will not see Kataleyah until she obtains her insurance. Mom shared that she called the 34th and Market CHOP location and they agreed to see Kataleyah in the meantime. 


Mom plans to transfer her PCP to the North Philly location after 12/1, since it is closer to home.


SW provided positive feedback to Mom for navigating this and getting Kataleyah set up with a PCP despite insurance barriers.


Mom denied any other SW needs at this time. SW encouraged Mom to reach out to SW if anything else arises prior to discharge.


Plan: SW will remain available for SW support.


Time Spent: 15 minutes
