SW encouraged mom to consider additional supports throughout remainder of hospitalization, SW reviewed visitor policy and mom added dad and pt's godparents to visitor list. Mom confirmed she was contacted by AFAHO via case worker Leyitha, inquired re: transport to office to p/u diapers, SW advised we could not provide this transport but referred to Maker's Place Diaper Depot in Trenton for supplies closer to home.
