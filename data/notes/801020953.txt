Progress: PACT members (DO Johnson, LSW Dombrowski) met with Savannah at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Oncology team joined shortly after and Savannah was able to call her mother (Stephanie) who was on speaker phone.  Savannah continues to be motivated to wean her pca so DO Johnson talked to hear about changes that would be made.  Oncology team shared with Savannah and Stephanie the MRI results and also that GI will be coming to talk to them tomorrow.


Savannah shared that it is hard to be in the room for so long and that it was good to get out of the room for the MRI.  Oncology team will look into whether it's possible for Savannah to leave the room for a visit to the Buerger garden.


Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with oncology sw.
