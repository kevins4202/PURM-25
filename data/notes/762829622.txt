SW met with pt mother at bedside to reintroduce self following PICU transfer and readmission to CCU. SW and mom spoke at length regarding pt's hospital stay and stress of required PICU admission. Mom expressed relief being back in the CCU environment and is hopeful for pt's recovery given significant improvement in clinical status. Mom reported that family was denied stay at RMH d/t pt's current RSV dx in addition to sibling and father currently managing illness at home. SW offered listing of local hotels who may offer RMH rate, however mom stated she is comfortable remaining bedside for now as pt is likely to be discharged in coming days. Will reassess lodging needs if admission is prolonged. Mom shared frequent hospitalizations have been overwhelming, but has found support in other families at RMH in previous stays as well as in church support group. SW reminded mom that she may reach out for MH resources if ever desired, which mom appreciated. No other needs identified at this time.


SW will continue to follow the family.
