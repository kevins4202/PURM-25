SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: RESOURCE NEEDS
Goal: Patient will have adequate insurance coverage to obtain necessary medical care
Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  SW attempted to call and text mom's cell phone to discuss issue that baby currently does not show active PA MA coverage as well as SW providing mom with SSI application info.  Mom did not return call before end of business day.  SW also spoke with DCF case worker who noted he would follow up with mom about this as well.  He noted that mom's 11yo is on MGM's insurance as MGM has custody of 11yo.  Mom currently only has a Medicare policy that is not able to cover baby.  SW noted to continue to work with case management and DCF to assist mom in correcting issues.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
