SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to illness/disability
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  Family meeting held this afternoon with pt's mother by phone, Dr Hogan, clinical supr, CM and SW.
Discussed the following:
-Introduction to CCB team members and roles
- Mom's goals for pt are to get off breathing support, eat by mouth and get out of the hospital
- Team restarted diuretic, which helped, and pt weaned to 3L mid week. Will wean 1x/week, from 3L to 2L to 1L to .5L, then remove oxgyen. With this schedule of weaning and no setbacks, discharge could occur last week of April.
- When pt reaches 2L of oxgyen, SLP will evaluate oral skills. Mom interested in meeting with SLP when the time occurs.
- Pt will likely need a feeding tube for discharge. Mom reports pt's twin was discharged with a feeding tube, so they are comfortable with that.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
