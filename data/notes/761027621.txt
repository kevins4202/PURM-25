 SW met with pt father to introduce role and inquire regarding any needs during this hospitalization. Dad shared that lodging is a current stressor, citing approximately 1 hour distance from CHOP to home, and family current ineligibility for stay at RMD Philadelphia as mother and pt sibling are currently sick with RSV. Dad shared he will likely stay bedside with pt until mom recovers and then switch so mom can be bedside while dad cares for sibling at home. Dad inquired regarding options for moving closer to CHOP for ease of travel citing frequent readmissions, SW advised that a LOMN could be provided to assist in expediting spot on any waitlists for affordable housing but offered that affordable housing options are extremely limited.
