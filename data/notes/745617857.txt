This SW is new to this case and received a signout from Lindsey Kunkel the NIICU social worker.   This SW will continue to follow this case as long as the baby is on the oncology unit.  CYS has been involved with this case since the baby's birth.   Concern at this time is that mom has not visited for several weeks.  SW was notified by Case Worker Megan Parker- (609-947-4656) that mom is incarcerated at Atlantic County Detention Center.  It is unclear at this time for how long mom will remain incarcerated and how to best contact her.  CYS will be looking into this and will provide SW with updates. 


Progress: On Going


Plan: SW will continue to provide emotional and practical support as needed.  Any concerns or problems let me know.


Time Spent: 60 minutes


Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
