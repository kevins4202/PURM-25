Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing









Progress:  Family meeting held today with parents, Dr. Feudtner, resident, CM and SW.
Discussed current medical concerns: 
Breathing - lungs need to grow and develop, will wean oxygen weekly with a goal of no oxygen for home, but pt may need
Feeding - pt currently has ND tube, easier to feed pt this way with respiratory issues, will likely change this to a G tube, either NG or GT (will wean down on oxygen support first)
Pt still receiving therapies, can coordinate for parents to be present to meet with therapists
Parents can choose a pediatrician
Time frame for discharge could be 4 weeks or longer
CM will arrange for supplies, encouraged parents to be present 


SW met with parents before and after the meeting. Explained unit and provided a tour. Parents are excited to be able to stay at bedside with pt more frequently. 




Plan: Will follow.
