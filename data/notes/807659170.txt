Progress: Focus meeting held today with mom, SW, Continuity RN Allison Singson, CM Lee Ane Young e to discuss disposition planning and possible barriers to discharge directly to home.

This home would still need to be inspected before moving forward with home discharge. 


Transition care was mentioned as a bridge to getting home should housing continue to be a barrier. Referrals may be made if housing is not identified in a timely manner.
