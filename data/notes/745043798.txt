Progress:  Nursing contacted SW that MGM Tonya Bouie had called nursing however nursing was unable to call MGM back.  At this point, parents have not provided for grandparents to receive any medical updates.  SW contacted MGM back and inquired for a good contact for mom as staff has been unable to reach in over a week.  SW provided MGM with the alternative phone number CYS had provided for mom, however MGM noted mom would be "away for the next few weeks but she is fine".  SW explained that as baby is in the ICU setting staff should have a way to contact parents in case of an emergency.  MGM noted she would attempt to get in contact with mom but by end of SW shift MGM was unable to reach mom.  Both CYS and MGM do not have a number for FOB.  SW informed CYS that medical team has been trying to reach mom.  To date nursing noted mom attempted to call in last week but nursing missed the call and staff has been unable to return calls/ numbers are inoperable.  Therefore, the medical team has not spoken to mom or dad since the family meeting which was on 9/1/22.  SW informed CYS case worker team wanted to discuss genetic testing, likelihood of patient benefiting from a g-tube, and due to patient status needing to be transferred to a pediatric floor.  However, nothing is emergent at this time.  CYS noted they would continue to make attempts with parents.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
