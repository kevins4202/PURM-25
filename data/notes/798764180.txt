Progress:  Social worker met with mother at bedside in the NICU. Mother shared how she has been coping over the last few weeks. She shared that she is glad that Gael has maintained stability more recently, and reflected on her feelings when Gael had required more support a couple of weeks ago. Mother shared that Gael's twin brother Ivan will most likely be discharging sooner than Gael. While she is glad that Ivan is approaching discharge, she expressed that she wishes that the twins could go home at the same time. Mother has returned to school and is continuing to visit every day.
