Progress: PACT members (MD Parikh, LSW Dombrowski) met with Savannah at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Savannah expressed that she was in pain and not up for much of a visit.  She expressed that the recent increase in her pain medication has helped some so she wanted to see how the rest of the day went before considering any other changes.  She was hopeful to get settled and watch a movie.


Plan: PACT SW will remain available for support in conjunction with oncology sw.


Time Spent: 15 minutes
