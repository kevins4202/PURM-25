SW met with mother at bedside this afternoon for introduction, support, and initial assessment. Mother receptive and easily engaged in conversation. 


Mother reports her sister is helping to take care of her older children while she is at the hospital with Majesti.


Mother talked about patient's recent discharge from NICU (on 6/14/22) and says overall he has been doing well at home. Mother reports she did not have extended family or friends visit at home as an extra precaution due to current COVID pandemic. While talking mother took a folder out of her bag which she reports keeping patient's discharge paperwork and follow-up appointments in. 


Mother reports patient developed symptoms a day prior to admission and she reached out to one of his past providers by phone for guidance. Father was visiting. Mother reports she and father contacted 911 when patient's condition worsened.


Mother reports DCPP has been involved since February 2022 after her and father's 12 year old daughter called 911 during a verbal argument in the home. Mother was pregnant with patient at that time. Mother states their caseworker Ashley (unknown last name) decided to keep the case active for supportive services. Per mother Ashley is aware of current admission.


Mother also reports receiving support through NJ DCA (Department of Community Affairs) related to housing and finances. Mother reports housing stability, says she is responsible for the electric bill and has been behind on payments.


Home environment screen completed: negative, resources declined.


Will plan to discuss with SCAN on 7/7/22. SW will remain available for ongoing support during admission.
