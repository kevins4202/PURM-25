Additional comments:  
SW approved meal vouchers for Dad and PGM at the bedside, as they remain at the bedside to complete caregiver training and discharge needs. 


SW and Dad discussed discharge transportation options for today. Dad's coworker is no longer available to drive them home. NJ ModivCare will not be an option due to family completing final education at 4:30pm, so discharge will be after 5pm. SW consulted SW Manager Sheronda Ball, who approved SW approval of a discharge Lyft in order to expedite a safe inpatient discharge. Redcaps Form completed. SW informed the family of how to order the Lyft when pt is ready for discharge.
