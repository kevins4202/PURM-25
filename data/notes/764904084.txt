Additional Comments: 


On-call SW was consulted by medical team for a physical altercation which occurred at bedside between Mother and Father. Security were also present. SW spoke with Mother and Father separately providing emotional support. Mother and Father have a history of disruptive hospital conduct and it has been determined they cannot co-exist and maintain appropriate bedside behavior. Mother states that there is currently no custody order or court involvement. Both parents agreed to a tentative visitation schedule starting today 12/10/2022 until Monday 12/12/2022. Mother will visit from 8am-8pm and Father will visit from 8pm-8am. Mother left hospital while Father remained at bedside. Father notified SW that he will be starting a new job on Thursday (12/15/2022) and this schedule will need to be revised due to his conflicting work hours. SW told Father that she will implement this schedule until Monday and send a message to Unit SW for revision during the week.
