Progress:  LSW spoke with the patient's mother on the phone with the assistance of Interpretalk (Interpreter Onida, ID #701989). LSW assessed mother's coping and additional needs. Patient's mother was appropriately tearful when discussing the care plan for Gisselle. The patient's mother continues to cope appropriately given the circumstances. The patient's father works six days a week and the patient's mother returned to work last week. 


The patient's mother has received medical bills for the patient causing additional stress. LSW forwarded the bills received by the patient's mother to FHC to include in the application. LSW informed the patient's mother that the Medicaid application was submitted this week and requested that it be effective from the patient's date of birth. The patient's mother is appreciative of FHC and LSW support.




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and assess needs.
