Progress:  SW spoke to pt's mother by phone. She has NGT (pump and gravity feeds) experience at home with another child (who ultimately passed away at CHOP while awaiting a liver transplant), but plans to visit bedside tomorrow to practice. Rent is paid in her current apt in Upper Darby PA until 2/18 when she will move to OH, outside of Columbus. Mom is not registered for WIC locally and has been buying formula with SNAP benefits; she has 6 cans of Similac Neosure at home. Mom has Uber credit to get to bedside and did not request assistance with transportation at discharge, but SW offered to contact CYS worker to see if he can assist; mom agreed. SW offered support. 


SW provided update to CYS worker, Alex Chip (484-724-0336). He can assist family at discharge if he is available. 


Plan: Will  update CYS worker next week and follow for other needs.
