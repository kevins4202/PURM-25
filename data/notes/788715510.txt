Progress: 


SW met with aunt (Joyce) with ASL interpreter by VRI to assess ongoing coping and needs and provide support. SW provided emotional support around upcoming surgery. 


SW was notified by team that Joyce was requesting a letter for her utility company. SW assessed further. Aunt shared that due to electrical work being done around the homes in her area, her utility company (UGI) requested documentation around individuals in the household who may have medical needs, to ensure their access to backup electricity/generators if needed. Aunt shared that she has obtained letters for herself and her youngest son who is deaf, and requested a letter for Messiah as well. SW shared that SW can provide a broad letter of anticipated needs and that Messiah is anticipated to be discharged home to her address. Letter was provided.


SW was notified that consent for surgery was obtained from mother (Margaret). CYS Caseworker Denise reached out to SW to confirm that consent was obtained, and SW confirmed. 


Per CYS Caseworker Denise and aunt Joyce, there is an upcoming court date 3/29. Joyce asked this SW if she is expected to attend court that date. SW contacted Caseworker Denise, who shared that court is related to mother only and not Joyce, however if Joyce wishes to attend, she would be permitted. SW relayed this to Joyce, and encouraged her to contact Denise directly for additional questions.


Plan: SW will continue to follow and provide support.
