TODAY'S TIME:  9:52 AM


Identified Areas: 
Insurance and Transportation


Progress: LSW rec'd request from RN to provide support to pts mother for transportation upon discharge. Pts mother informed LSW that she does have transportation available by pts grandmother; however, she will need to notify pts grandmother ahead of time when she needs to be picked up due to pt residing over an hour away. Pts mother is aware of anticipated discharge tomorrow. 


LSW also checked in with pts mother re: status of FHCP documents being submitted. Pts mother informed LSW that all documents were submitted to FHCP coordinator except for the utility bill due to pts paternal uncle having to locate this document. Pts mother reported that she believes that all utilities are paid directly to landlord so she is uncertain if a utility bill is available. LSW contacted FHCP requesting confirmation if lease or any other documentation can be provided in place of utility bill.  


Plan: LSW will wait for follow-up from FHCP coordinator and will follow-up appropriately with pts mother. LSW provided update to RN and medical team regarding transportation home and if possible, to provide an anticipated time for discharge for transportation coordination purposes. 


Time Spent: 30 minutes
