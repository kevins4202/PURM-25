Progress:  Social worker met with parents at bedside in the NICU. Parents shared the range of emotions they have been experiencing since Liam's birth. They shared that it has, understandably, been challenging to manage the emotions around the uncertainty of Liam's future needs. They shared their experience over the last few years in caring for Liam's older brother, who has a congenital syndrome. Supportive counseling was provided. We briefly discussed some coping strategies to consider. We identified some resources that may be useful for parents to review in the future, which social worker will follow up to provide to parents. Mother is interested in counseling referrals in the family's area, which social worker will provide. Parents identified no other immediate social work needs at this time. 




Plan: Social worker will continue to follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
