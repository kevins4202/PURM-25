PICU SW met with mom in the hall as her child was being stabilized. Came in for OSH and mom tearyied about her 4 month old son.  SW spoke with Mom lives with Dad and 2 other children. Mom works at newark airport. Has extended family. Maternal aunt with her now . Dad is with mom bedside.


PICU SW continues to offer support also concrete resources.  Mom was too upset to answer all questions in the assessment as it was not the most appropriate time to ask.


Overall mom and family coping best as they can.
