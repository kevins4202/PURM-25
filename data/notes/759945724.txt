Adjustment - Intervention - hospitalization:

 Assist patient/family/caregiver in problem-solving for hospitalization-related stressors
 Provide patient/family/caregiver with supportive counseling





Progress:  LSW met with the patient's mother at the bedside several times during the week to assess coping and provide support. The patient's mother is coping as expected given the circumstances. Tyara was appropriately tearful when talking about Kyrain's surgery timeline and expressed her desire for him to be home with her. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with the patient's mother to address thoughts and feelings related to Kyrain's ongoing hospitalization. LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address stressors. Tyara will be returning to work three days a week (Friday to Sunday). The patient's mother feels this will be helpful in her coping with the patient's ongoing hospitalization. 


The patient's mother requested assistance with Kyrain's SSI application. SSI has requested additional documentation to confirm Kyrain Trisomy 21 diagnosis. LSW faxed a copy of the Genetics note in the patient's chart to SSI. 




Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and assess needs.




Time Spent: 60 minutes
