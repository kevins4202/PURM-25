Progress:  A family meeting was held over the phone with NIICU Attending Eric Eichenwald MD, NIICU Resident Caitlin Cristante MD, bedside nurse Sara Klausner RN, Case Manager Stephanie Hill-Sandoval RN, LSW and Levi's parents.


Dr. Cristante explained to the patient's parents that Levi is now being appropriately supported with BiPAP. Respiratory weans will be made as indicated and will likely take weeks to months given Levi's lung disease. Additionally, Levi's feeds have been transitioned to ND and Clonidine has been started to help with Levi's agitation. These changes have been shown to be helpful for Levi. 


The patient's parents asked appropriate and thoughtful questions during the meeting and demonstrated their understanding of Levi's medical needs. 


LSW validated the patient's parent's experience and empowered them to continue advocating for Levi. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
