Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress:  LSW met with Gisselle's mother at the bedside and utilized the VRI Spanish Interpreter to speak with mom. The patient's mother continues to cope well given the circumstances and is actively implementing strategies to promote healthy coping. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with Gisselle's mother. LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address stressors related to Gisselle's hospitalization. 


Gisselle's mother was able to schedule an SSI interview for 3/14/23. LSW provided guidance on the interview process and the information needed to be prepared for the interview. 


While LSW was meeting with Gisselle's mother, the medical team came to the bedside to provide a medical update. The patient's mother asked thoughtful questions and demonstrated understanding of the plan moving forward. Dr. Burris asked the patient's mother if the parents would like to renew the DNR order. The patient's mother shared that the parents would like the DNR to remain in place and they will reach out to the medical team if they no longer want the order.




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
