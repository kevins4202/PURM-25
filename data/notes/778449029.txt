Progress:  Covering SW was consulted by nursing as MGM was utilizing sleep room overnight while parents were both at bedside until approx. 4am and switched.  Parents also were unable to exit sleep room at normal time due to oversleeping.  SW spoke with grandmother using VRI for spanish interpreter along with parents via phone.  SW reiterated that per staff they were told previously about sleep room visitor policies as well as RMH.  SW reminded family that MGM is not allowed in sleep rooms due to both parents being involved/ 2 assigned caregivers.  Also someone has to utilize RMH room each night in order to keep their room/ privileges at the house.  Family noted understanding of the rules and acknowledged there wouldn't be further issues.  SW also spoke with RMH who was unaware of family not staying there overnight however parents continue to be allowed at the house.  SW also provided emotional support upon family concerned with OR planned for today as MGM was tearful.  SW also signed out to CICU social worker for weekend depending on timing of patient coming back to NICU.  Mom also had questions regarding insurance and transport bill which SW consulted case manager to follow up with mom.
