   PACT SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Girl A-Lashay Stevens
CHOP MRN#: 56912936
DOB:  10/31/2022
TODAY'S DATE:  3/22/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  4:32 PM


Problems: 
Hospitalization and Coping with illness/disability 


Progress: PACT members (MD Parikh, LSW Dombrowski) met with both parents (Tahir and Lashay) at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Parents shared with us their discussions with the neurology team about the EEG results showing seizures.  They expressed wanting to talk through further about medications and possible risks and benefits as they already see Aubree more sleepy.  They are hopeful that Aubree can get breaks off of her respiratory support as she seems more awake during those times.  They are also hopeful for Aubree's pediatrician to be updated on the last several weeks.  This was all relayed to PICU MD Fowler.


Parents express how understandably exhausting this has all been as they are also supporting Aubree's twin and their 2 yo son "TK" as well.  Father is starting a new job at the Navy yard in shipping soon as well.




Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with PICU SW.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
