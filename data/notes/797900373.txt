SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing



Progress:  LSW met with the patient's mother yesterday and today at the bedside to provide support. The patient's mother was appropriately tearful when talking about the possibility that Sully will need to be intubated. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling while meeting with the patient's mother.  The patient's mother is coping as expected given the circumstances and is able to articulate needs. 


LSW provided Sully's mother with the NICU parent's group calender and a community resource for a NICU parent group.


Sully's mother would like to meet with Psychology for additional support during Sully's hospitalization. LSW reached out to Psychology to collaborate in supporting the patient's parents. 


Plan:  LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
