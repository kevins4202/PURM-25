SW and FLC MD Annie Gula met with DCPP representatives together to provide background medical information around underlying diagnoses and current admission. DCPP received report that patient was admitted due to sepsis from pressure wound; medical team confirmed this was not reason for admission. Per medical team, reason for admission was gastroenteritis and dehydration. MD Gula reviewed that GI illness and dehydration impacted Jamal so severely due to his underlying conditions.
