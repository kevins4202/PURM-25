Discharge Planning


Progress: 
Patient's CUA worker, Lisa Crump, came to CHOP to visit the patient. SW and Lisa touched base in regards to discharge planning and what else is needed. Lisa shared that we are all waiting for a response from DHS in regards to the weekly nursing visits that had been suggested in the latest meeting with the team. DHS is waiting on clarification whether that can happen or not.
SW shared that the patient is all clear medically and set with medical daycare and can start any day now. SW expressed the importance of this as the team would not want for his spot to be taken due to extended delays in starting at the facility.
Lisa plans to make a few phone calls to try to get some answers in a timely manner.


Lisa also requested the patient's medical progress notes.

SW will continue to follow and provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.
