SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE


Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver progress in adjustment to diagnosis
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  A family meeting was held with Nicolas Bamat MD, case manager Stephanie Hill-Sandoval RN, bedside nurse Madalyn Betley RN, covering LSW and both parents.


Dr. Bamat explained the importance of Zidane getting a G-tube and Nissan surgery for his growth and nutritional needs. Parents were made aware that the patient may not learn to feed by mouth for years given his Chronic Lung Disease. The medical team is recommending that the patient undergo the G-tube and Nissan surgery now in hopes that it would improve his ability to wean on the respiratory support. The patient's parents asked thoughtful and appropriate questions that demonstrated their understanding. Parents will discuss this together and let the team know if they are comfortable proceeding with the surgery. 




Plan: Social work will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
