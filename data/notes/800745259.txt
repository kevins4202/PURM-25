Problems: 
Hospitalization 


Progress: SW met with patient's grandmother at the bedside for supportive check-in. Grandmom is doing well post-surgery and is returning back to work today. She was hoping to do some training but the educator comes in at 2pm and grandmom has to leave to get to work. SW asked about patient's mother and grandmother stated that she has not been home in about 4 days so she does not know what is going on with her. Grandmother expressed disappointment that her daughter is not doing what she needs to do for her son. Grandmother stated that she may have someone else that is interested in training. SW stated that we are unable to train additional people at this time due to lack of training progress from her and mom. Grandmother understood. SW informed grandmother that we are still pursuing transitional care but both she and mom should continue training until a bed becomes available. Grandmother said that she will be back on Wednesday to do some training. 


SW sent picture of patient to mother via text. 


Plan: SW will continue to assess for psychosocial needs and provide supportive counseling.
