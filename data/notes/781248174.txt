Mom and baby live together in rented room in a house in Hamilton, NJ. Baby has a crib. There are 2 other tenants in the house in addition to pt's cousin. Dad does not live with the family, but does live locally and plans to move in with family in near future. Dad began working for Coca-cola (mom unsure of exact position) in beginning of February, mom is currently not working and relies on pt's aunt for financial support. Per mom, family has enough infant supplies to get by at this time but is unsure how they will sustain long-term. 


With mom's permission, SW referred family to African Family Health Organization (AFAHO - 215 546 1232 ) for additional supports. The organization will call mom with Haitian Creole speaking staff member to complete assessment of needs.
