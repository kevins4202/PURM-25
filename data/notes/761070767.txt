TODAY'S DATE:  11/23/2022

Progress: 
SW called mom to check in since SW has not been able to catch mom at bedside. Mom shared she is doing well and just trying to adjust with working, parenting her other children and also be present for patient. Mom shared it is a lot but she is trying her best. SW asked if mom will be present today at beside and she said that she does plan to come in today, but she did not want to provide a time since it is often times hard to stick with a specific time due to catching public transportation. SW encouraged mom to let SW know when she arrives or what day she does plan to come so that they could meet in person. SW also encouraged mom to reach out if any needs arise and/or if she needs any resources.


Plan: 
SW will continue to follow up with patient's mom while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 15 minutes


Acuity: Level 1 - Adequate resources to meet needs
