Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: Mom reached out to SW via text message that she submitted the request for the birth certificate on the same day SW told her about it, but has still not received it. SW relayed that since it has been over a month, it may be worth reaching out to them and checking on the status of the request. 


SW also received an email from Yaseen's school RN, Denise Bateson (dbateson@mciu.org), that they recently had an IEP meeting with Mom and she shared that she will be pursuing residential placement for Yaseen. School RN asked if it would be appropriate to say that Yaseen will not be returning to school this year (the school year ends in 20 days). SW confirmed. 


Plan: SW will continue to follow. SW will continue to work with Mom on getting Yaseen registered for IDS. 


Time Spent: 15 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
