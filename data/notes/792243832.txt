SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE




Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing




Progress:  LSW met with the patient's father at the bedside while Leo was in IR. The patient's father was appropriately worried about Leo but understood that it was best for Leo to get the Broviac. The patient's father was able to articulate his thoughts and feeling related to seeing Leo intubated again. LSW provided supportive counseling and validated the patient's father's experience. The patient's father is actively implementing strategies to address stressors and was receptive to additional strategies provided by LSW. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.  Advocacy required
