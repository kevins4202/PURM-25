Progress: SW met with mom bedside and Savannah to offer SW support. Mom asked SW about the RMH. SW called and confirmed the family has a room request in for Feb 25th and Feb 26th. 


Mom also inquired about HSP. This writer emailed a referral form and has not heard back. This writer explained it they usually wait until the patient has been admitted for 10 days before initiating contact. This writer also ensured mom he has been in communication with Savannahs school and sent them a letter last week. 


Mom reported through e-mail later in the day: John,
Well, when I finally checked the NY Life website, it appears my leave is approved through 3/17. So, I'll work with the BMT SW on the next set of paperwork, unless I hear otherwise from NY Life. Thank you for meeting with me today, it really alleviated many of my concerns. 


Thank you,
Stephanie Miller
