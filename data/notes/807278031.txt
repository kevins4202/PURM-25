Conflict within family 


Progress: 
SW contacted patient's parents via phone to introduce SW and assess for needs. Both mom and dad provided SW with information on their court hearing for Thursday 6/15/23 to get a PFA against them lifted from another party. Mom and dad are hoping that it goes in their favor so that they can start to become more present bedside and possibly stay at RMH. Parents shared that they were currently going to get everything together for the court hearing and will let SW know if any needs arise. SW encouraged family to reach out directly.


Plan:
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.
