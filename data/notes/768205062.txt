Mother is amenable with use of adult coloring materials at bedside for coping and distraction from any negative comments made by patient; CLS team aware and will provide to mother.  


SW informed mother that yelling at bedside with patient is not tolerated, and encouraging bedside breaks if mother needs in order to maintain behavioral control.
