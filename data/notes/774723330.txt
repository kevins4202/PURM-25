Progress:  Social worker received call from Delaware County CYS worker Alex Chip (484-724-0336) providing update. Social worker spoke with mother by phone. Mother shared that she spoke with her landlord and her landlord has approved for the family to remain at their current residence through the end of February. Mother noted that she hopes that Antonio will be discharged by then so that the family can move together to Ohio. As such, mother wishes to put transfer to Nationwide on hold. Social worker relayed this update to the medical team. 


Mother shared the she submitted the online application for Ohio Medicaid in preparation for the family's relocation to Ohio in the coming weeks, however mother explained that the application was denied as the family was missing documentation demonstrating proof of residency. Mother plans to resume the application process once the family arrives in Ohio. 


Mother received Uber gift card from Harp's Hope. It remains challenging for mother to visit Antonio at the hospital with limited child care for Antonio's three older siblings. Social worker provided information about financial assistance organizations that may be able to assist with paying bills or a month of rent. Mother is interested in a referral. Social worker will follow up to submit an application to the Colette Louise Tisdahl Foundation. Social worker offered to advocate to the family's landlord on behalf of the family should Antonio's hospitalization continue into March.
