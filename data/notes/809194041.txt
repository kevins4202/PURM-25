Progress:  The following team members met with mom and dad for trach talk:
Lindsey Kunkel, SW
Daniel Malleske, Attending
Stephanie Hill-Sandoval, Case Manager
Rosemary Patel, ENT NP
Jody Lebron, RN


ENT discussed tracheostomy surgery, training, and discussed anatomy images with parents.  Team noted encouragement with baby's progress however he will likely require a trach to get out of the hospital however he may not require a ventilator or ventilation for long.  Team discussed complexities of discharging to home for family since they are Amish and do not use electricity.  Team noted a generator is a not a safe discharge plan for a primary electrical source for a ventilator.  Parents noted they would need to speak to their Bishop/ family before making a decision about putting electricity in the home.  However, team discussed potential for PSC transitional care location in Lancaster which is only 30 minutes from their home as an option.  Parents appreciated information, asked appropriate questions, and also wanted to know more about the g-tube which team noted would likely be done with the tracheostomy/ which RN showed parents post meeting.  Parents appreciated support and noted they would be in touch with team if family has further questions.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.


Time Spent: 90 minutes
