SW met with Ms. Eitenne to inquire about transportation to check for barriers to and from future outpatient appointments. Ms. Eitenne expressed that she would need assistance with transportation. SW called Modiv Care Delaware (information listed below) and patient qualifies for transportation to and from the hospital. Rides will need to be scheduled 3 business days in advance. SW will inform Ms. Eitenne on how to schedule rides in the near future. 
Ms. Eitenne also expressed that she is interested in locating new housing and currently resides in an apartment. Ms. Eitenne stated that her husband is working and able to financially support a larger apartment. SW searched online for available apartments in the Magnolia Delaware area. SW will provide Ms. Eitenne the list of apartments. 
Lastly, Ms. Eitenne showed SW a form (Acknowledgenment of Paternity form) and wanted to know what it means. SW researched the meaning of the form. The form is through Pennsylvania law and given to parents to sign in the hospital. The form is given to parents when a child is born to parents who are not married. 
No additional concerns reported during the meeting. 
SW will continue to provide support as needed in regard to continuity of care.
