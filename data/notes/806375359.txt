Progress: SW introduced herself to patient's mother and grandmother who were present at bedside, and explained that she will be working with them while patient was in the N/IICU.

However, mom still has consenting rights and consent needs to go through her. Please see previous SW notes which gives more information. MGM asked about resources such as parking and food vouchers.
