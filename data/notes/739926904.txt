Helen White-Ballard is a 15 day old female twin gestation with no prenatal care with unknown past history, no prenatal care who presents with hypothermia at first pediatrician visit this morning. 


SW was consulted to complete an assessment. Prior to meeting with pts mother at bedside, SW received a call from Burlington County DCPP caseworker Mackenzie Barnes (609-649-9657). Mackenzie informed SW that the family has an active case with child protective services due to concerns for neglect, substance abuse, as well as other safety concerns. DCPP reports that the pts mother has a total of 8 children, ages 12,11,7,4,4,2, and the pt and twin brother. DCPP explains that all 6 children were previously removed from mothers care. Per DCPP, 5 of the children were reunified with mom, and 1 was adopted. Pt currently lives in a motel in New Jersey with his mother, father, and 5 siblings. Per DCPP, the family was asked to leave the motel by tomorrow, and will be homeless. Per DCPP, they went to the motel early last week for a visit, and saw the pt, and her twin brother for the first time. DCPP reports that pts mother and father told them that the twins were moms sisters, and they were just babysitting. DCPP told mom that she is currently receiving services through them, and is not able to care for her sisters children. DCPP reports that they went back to the motel on Friday 8/12, and saw that the twins were still there. DCPP explained that pts mother and father admitted that the pt and her twin were their children. Per DCPP, Mother reported that she did not receive any prenatal medical care, and delivered the pt and her twin at the motel alone. Per DCPP, they told mother and father that the pt and twin sibling needed to go to a doctor by Tuesday 8/16.  DCPP reports that the pt and sibling first saw a medical provider today 8/17. Per DCPP, the pt and twin were sent to ED due to Hypothermia. DCPP reports that due to current safety concerns, they are bringing pts 5 siblings to ED for medical evlaution. Per DCPP, pt is not to be discharged without approval of safe discharge plan. 



SW met with pts mother at beside. Pts mother was guarded when speaking with social work, and did not want to engage in social work assessment. SW was able to build rapport with mom, and was able to complete assessment. Mom confirmed that she has 8 children, 7 whom live at home with her and the pts father. Mom reports that she gave birth to the pt and twin sibling at home without medical care. Per mom, she delivered three of her other children at home, and reports having experience delivering babies at home. Mom reports that she did not take the pt or twin to receive medical care, due to them appearing "normal". Per mom she took the pt and twin to the PCP this morning for the first time due to DCPP advising her too. Mom reports a history with DCPP for unknown reasons. Mom denies a history of mental health, legal issues or substance abuse. Mom reports that her and pts father are both currently unemployed. Mom expressed being upset due to feeling "blind sided " by the ED visit. SW provided active listening and emotional support to pts mother.
