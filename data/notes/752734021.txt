Progress:  LSW spoke with Gisselle's mother with the assistance of Interpretalk (ID# 700838) to assess coping and additional need. The patient's mother was appropriately tearful when discussing Gisselle's medical needs. Maribel shared her continued concern for Gisselle's suffering related to her ongoing hospitalization. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling to address Maribel's coping. Gisselle's mother reported variability to improvements in completing daily tasks and decreased levels of anxiety. The patient's mother is actively implementing strategies to address anxiety and stress and continues to be receptive so LSW and Psychology support. Maribel highlighted her Catholic faith as a source of support in this time. LSW coordinated with Spiritual Care to facilitate priest visit today at 6 pm.
