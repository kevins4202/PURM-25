Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization

Progress:  SW returned a phone call to pt's mother. She reports that dad hopes to come to bedside tomorrow to watch pt's siblings while mom attends class, but he doesn't have ID. SW called dad and confirmed previous SW plans for dad to bring his birth certificate; dad reports a family member has his birth certificate and is out of town, so he is not sure when he can get it, however he will go to mom's house and watch siblings there, if he cannot come to bedside. Dad thanked SW for reaching out. 




Plan: Will follow.
