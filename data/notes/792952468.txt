Problems: 
Visitation restrictions 


Progress: Improved
SW spoke with mom briefly via phone today as SW was not able to complete assessment during shift.  SW discussed plan to call mom tomorrow to complete assessment.  Mom noted clarification regarding visitor restriction as mom noted admissions "wasn't sure" if parents were able to sign admissions paperwork as well as parents were not allowed to receive parent badge.  SW validated mom's concerns and that parents did not have legal custody changes and remain with legal and consenting rights for baby.  SW noted to follow up with welcome desk and admissions staff to ensure all staff is compliant with current restrictions and legal process for family.  Mom appreciated support.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization.
