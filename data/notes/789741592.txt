Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing





Progress:  LSW provided the patient's mother with guidance on requesting a room at the Ronald McDonald house. Parents are interested in staying there on the weekends. The patient's mother is considering leaving her job when Levi gets closer to discharge and staying at the RMD full time until Levi is ready to go home. 


The patient's mother has asked that the medical team call her every other day to provide plan of care updates. The medical team will reach out to the patient's mother accordingly. 


Per Nursing leadership, a one time visitor exception has been made for Levi's maternal aunt to visit the weekend of 4/7/23 and have maternal grandmother re added to the list on 4/10/23. LSW informed the patient's mother and she verbalized her appreciation of the exception. 




Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
