SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE










Progress:  SW met with parents. Mother said since she delivered early (her due date was December 13, and she planned to take leave starting December 6) her NJ Temporary Disability/Family Leave will not start. Mother stopped working mid November and was first admitted to the SDU on 11/15/22, and re-admitted on 11/17/22. SW called the number on the website but was unable to reach a representative. Mother attempted to re-file the claim but was not able to.


Mother talked about her reservations about breastfeeding, mother said she had decided she wasn't going to because she watched videos of babies hurting their mothers. Mother said she was told by the medical team that breast milk is the best nourishment to help Quincy grow and heal. Mother expressed feelings of guilt about this, SW validated mother's feelings and supported her. Mother said she has used the pump at Chop and is waiting for hers to arrive, Chop can rent mother one but it will cost $80 and parents are hesitant to pay this since one should be delivered soon. Mother is concerned, however, that her milk will dry up. Mother has spoken with the lactation specialist and did not want SW to contact lactation about this.


SW provided parents with six parking vouchers and a Harp's Hope card to help with gas money.




Plan: SW will follow up next week to confirm mother's OB/GYN filed the paperwork mother provided and establish if the payments will start earlier because Quincy delivered early.


2:45 PM - Chop Lactation Specialist contacted SW to provide information about Chop "loaner" breast pumps and to encourage mother to feel comfortable making her own decisions about breastfeeding and pumping. SW passed along the phone number (267-426-5325) and again supported mother in making the decision that works best for her family.
