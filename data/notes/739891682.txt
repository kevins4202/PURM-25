Progress:  LSW met with the patient's parents at the bedside while the mother was holding Thomas. LSW assessed parents coping. Patient's father and mother are both coping appropriately given the circumstances. The parents have adjusted to being in the hospital daily with Thomas. The patient's father will return to work at the end of the month. LSW collaborated with the patient's parents to create a plan to address stressors related to Thomas's hospitalization. Parents continue to be appreciative of LSW support.
