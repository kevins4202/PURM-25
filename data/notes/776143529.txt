SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  SW was unable to reach pt's mother on mobile phone, so called CYS worker, Alex Chip. Provided medical update (MRI tonight, which will determine plan). He provided alternate phone # for mom, which SW was able to reach her on. 
Mom has 3 other children (ages 2, 3 and 6); she was to visit bedside today, but one of them is not feeling well. Mom reports her current rent is paid beyond the end of Jan, but she is not sure if it is for the whole month of Feb or half of the month; SW encouraged her to call her to aunt to find out. SW also provided information for home environment resource that may be able to assist. She has a gift card from the NICU with a $90 credit for Lyft to be able to visit. SW informed mom of another foundation that may be able to assist, but suggested we wait to find out the medical plan.




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
