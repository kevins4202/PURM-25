SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE










Progress:  SW received consult from nursing. SW met with mother at bedside regarding her request to speak with SW. Patient's mother reports concerns that patient's father will add his significant other to patient's visitor list. Mother reports father's s/o is not allowed contact. SW coordinated with RN to have any changes to visitation okay'd by patient's mother first. Mother declined any concerns that father's s/o will come to hospital unannounced. Mother declined need for visitor restriction but confirmed she would reach out to SW should any changes/concerns arise. SW reviewed current visitor list and discussed nurses being aware of situation. SW discussed parents sharing the visitor list and clarified that visitor cannot be added by father directly. Mother expressed appreciation for the visit. No other SW concerns noted at this time.


Plan: SW will continue to follow and reassess needs throughout admission to 9 South. Social Work supports will be offered as appropriate throughout hospitalization.






Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 3 - Require support / counseling / coaching.Â  Advocacy required
