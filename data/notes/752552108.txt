SW met with parents at bedside. Parents are adjusting to the unexpected diagnosis and NIICU hospitalization. Mother was just discharged yesterday from the hospital. Cashtyn was born via C-Section. Mother said after delivery he was having some trouble breathing, the OSH did imaging which showed a L CDH. It was undiagnosed until then. Parents are right now driving back and forth, they have a five year-old at home. Father works as an automotive technician, he does not get paid leave and has not applied for FMLA. Mother works part time as hair stylist. She has some paid leave and is not planning to return to work for a while. SW discussed with parents how many families find it difficult to figure out how to bond with their child when they are unable to hold them. Families with siblings face the additional challenge of discussing the NICU stay with their older children. Mother said their five year-old daughter is very observant; she noticed on the Angel Eye the pulse oximeter was on Cashtyn's one foot one day and the other foot the next day. Parents have the support of family and friends- their dog is being cared for by a family member and (their cats are more flexible) but are looking at longer term adjustments to be made. Parents were open to speaking with NIICU Psychologist and CLSP. Parents had questions about visitation, SW and RN explained visitor policy to parents. Parents have permission to have a one-time exception for one visit by grandfather.
