SOCIAL WORK CARE PLAN NOTE






Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  SW met with pt's mother at bedside to check in and address SDOH screener. Mom coping as best as she can, but is happy pt is out of the ICU. Mom reports she was recently fired due to taking time off for this admission, but is working with HR so she can return. Parents also obtained a car since last admission and sometimes drive to visit vs taking the train although, for one person traveling, the cost is almost equal. Addressed utility concern on screener; mom reports her bill is high, but she is on a payment plan. SW offered to have possible other resources sent; mom agreed. SW will refer to SW care coordinator. Also addressed MH screening; mom appropriately upset around events requiring this admission; denies SI; open to support. 




Plan: Will follow. 




Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
