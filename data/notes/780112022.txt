Problem: ADJUSTMENT
Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing






Progress:  LSW met with Rocco's mother at the bedside to provide emotional support and assess coping. The patient's mother continues to cope well given the circumstances and identified ways in which she was implementing strategies to promote healthy coping. LSW collaborated with the patient's mother to create a plan to address stressors related to Rocco's ongoing hospitalization. 
The patient's mother verbalized her thoughts and feelings surrounding the ups and downs of Rocco's treatment plan. LSW provided emotional support and supportive counseling to validate the patient's mothers experience. 


The patient's mother would like to meet with the medical team to discuss the overall care plan and the steps for getting Rocco home. LSW will coordinate the family meeting for next week.


No other social work needs identified at this time.


Plan: LSW will continue to follow and provide support.
