Social work continues to follow this patient.  


Additional Comments: SW outreached patient's York County CYS worker Ashley Althoff via email requesting a call to discuss any updates on identifying placement for patient. 


Ashley responded via email reporting that it is unlikely discharge will occur today or this weekend due to not having an identified foster family yet. SW inquired if team should expect supervised visit with mother and father on 6/12 at 10am. Ashley reports parents have yet to confirm planned visit and if they do not confirm with the agency, visit will not take place. Ashley reports she will update SW if parents confirm and explained that if visit does take place it will be supervised by an agency case aid rather than herself. 


SW remains available as needed. 


Time Spent: 60 minutes
