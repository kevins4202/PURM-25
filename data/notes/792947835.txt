Stated that upon observing feeds yesterday, family felt pt was still hungry as he was placing his hands and parents hands to mouth. Parents also expressed feeling "nervous" about handling NG supplies at home and feel more comfortable with NG feeds. SW informed FLOC, RN, SLP, and RD - SLP to call family to explain rationale for NG feeding.


SW and team planning to regroup with family early next week to discuss discharge goals and level of comfort with caring for infant in interstage period.
