Progress: 
SW contacted mom to introduce SW and services, all while assessing for needs at the moment. Mom shared she was in need of information in regard to what is currently going on with the patient in order to assist with her SSI application. SW asked if she had access to MyCHOP and mom said yes, but she was hoping for a print out in order to have a hard copy to refer to once she visits this evening. SW shared she will print out the latest progress note and leave it at bedside. 
SW encouraged mom to reach out if any additional needs arise.
