Progress: 


SW attempted to reach father yesterday without success, received return text in evening. SW coordinated via text to speak with father this afternoon. SW called with Interpretalk Haitian Creole interpreter 257330 and spoke to father at length to complete additional assessment and offer ongoing support. 


SW discussed Syamin's current communication, verbalization, and ongoing assessment of baseline and behavior vs neurological changes. 
Father shared that when he visited last weekend with aunt and cousin, Syamin 'talked a lot' and was similar to his baseline. Father shared that he felt Syamin was much improved over the weekend. Again shared that he 'does not talk much' in general. Father stated that Syamin spoke to family in full sentences when visiting in Haitian Creole.
SW inquired about Syamin's communication in school. Father shared that when initially starting school, school reported that Syamin would not speak much, if at all. Father shared that Syamin did not receive any therapies, was in ESL classes to support learning English, and over time improved.
SW also discussed current use of diapers and confirmed that Syamin was not using them prior to hospitalization. SW touched base with Child Life and encouraged further discussion with nursing. SW will also connect with therapies (PT/OT/ST) to collaborate in supporting Syamin and family. Father shared that he has heard that Syamin will require ongoing rehabilitation and is open to discussing benefits of rehab at CHOP if recommended.


SW encouraged father to come back in during the week to meet with providers, discuss next steps in medical plans, and assist with establishing further assessment of baseline to support Syamin's ongoing recovery. Father in agreement though in need of transportation assistance. SW approved transportation as noted below. 
Father will arrive at 2:30-3:00p tomorrow (Wednesday).

Father reports that he does not have good phone service at his work location, also reported recent difficulty getting through with CHOP Speaks Your Language last two days, was able to utilize successfully last week. SW offered to coordinate timing for updates and will reach out to Language Services for additional support.
Father works until 3:30p, also with break from 12-1p.


Housing: 
SW also assessed housing status further. Father confirmed that they currently reside with family (paternal grandmother, paternal aunt, and cousin) and that pt and father share a room. Father shared that the family will need to re-locate in July because the owner sold the residence they are in. 
Father hopeful to find affordable housing for himself, pt, and paternal grandmother in near future. SW discussed connecting with a program to assist with multiple needs, father amenable and appreciative of referral.


Immigration:
SW working to connect family with additional support with immigration needs. Father has previously shared family has been applying for mother to come to US. SW drafted letter of support to submit to embassy, discussed its limitations and encouraged father to connect with additional assistance with referrals from SW. SW has contacted HIAS-PA. SW also connected with CARC (info below) who can assist further with referrals and financial support. 


Program referral:
SW communicated with Ana Jezidzic, Program Manager at Community Affairs and Resource Center (CARC) in NJ. SW confirmed the CARC can provide various services including interpretation, assistance with applications for benefits, housing support, and more. CARC stated that they can connect family with an immigration attorney and/or agency and may be able to offer financial assistance with this as well. CARC willing to contact father directly and has staff who speak Haitian Creole. Father in agreement.
