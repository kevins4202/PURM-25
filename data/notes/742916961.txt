Social Work Telephone Note



Problem: schedule family meeting for week of 9/5/22 
Progress:  Covering SW left message for mother re: med team's desire to hold family meeting next week. Requested call back.


SW called father to discuss above. Father noted he does not yet have next week's work schedule but will tomorrow. He works FT as a cook. SW and father agreed to speak tomorrow re: day and time in which he and mother will be available to come for meeting. 



Plan: SW to outreach to father tomorrow re: work schedule.
SW to coordinate with med team date and time for family meeting


ADDENDUM 9/2/22 1200
Covering SW called father again, he reported he has not yet received his work schedule and therefore cannot say what day is best for the meeting. SW also outreached to mother via phone to inform attempting to schedule family meeting but no answer. SW left message. 
SW to inform team of status by end of day.
