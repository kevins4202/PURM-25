Goal: Patient/family/caregiver receive supportive counseling and/or resource referrals to assist in adjustment to hospitalization
Outcome: Ongoing







Progress:  SW spoke to pt's mother by phone. 
Re: PMD - Asked mom to call and schedule an appt since the office would not allow our CTA to schedule. Mom reports that pt's insurance under dad is active (issue was resolved). (SW will leave health center information with team in case it is needed).
Re: WIC - SW called county WIC office and they report that Enfamil Neuropro is covered with a WIC prescription form. SW called mom to inform her of this. E-mailed her phone  number and location of closest WIC office. MD to leave form at bedside.
Re: SSI - SW informed mom she does not need to apply, as pt will likely no  longer qualify.
Re: Medicaid application - Mom reports she is still awaiting her tax return, needed to apply through FHCP. SW informed mom she could apply online and likely would not need all the same documentation; emailed her the website.




Plan: Will remain available.
