Progress:  On 9/7/22 LSW spoke with the patient's mother on the patient's great grandmother's phone. LSW reiterated the importance of the patient's mother having a working phone number while Roman is in the hospital. The patient's mother verbalized that she will work on getting her phone fixed but noted that the best way to get in contact with her at this point is through the great grandmother. 
The patient's mother asked to have a family meeting with the medical team to get a detailed update. The patient's mother had specific questions about when Roman would be ready for discharge and what his medical needs may be at that time. The patient's mother indicated that she plans on coming to visit Roman on Thursday and would like to meet with the medical team then. 


On 9/8/2022 LSW communicated with the patient's mother and confirmed a family meeting for today at 2 pm. LSW attempted to reach out to the patient's mother via text message and phone call. The patient's number is not accepting calls at this time.
