Progress: Dream and her family are known to PACT and were asked to re-engage with the family prior to planned family meeting.  PACT members (LSW Dombrowski, MD Kester) met with both parents (Alicia and Brian) at bedside to assess needs and provide support.  Parents shared how well Dream has been doing and how they continue to want to follow her lead and optimize her care and development to see how she can do.  They are expecting a family meeting and expressed that it would be most helpful to focus on milestones that would get them to discharge.  They are hopeful to hear about the necessary next steps and are hopeful that they can get training for her nutritional needs at home, training for any oxygen support she may go home on and also cpr training.  They are also looking for help in scheduling future visits.  Family is aware that PACT can be asked to join any of their outpatient visits here at the main campus if there are PACT related needs.  Parents shared photos from their Thanksgiving Day here at the hospital.


PACT SW communicated with unit SW Kucharski to collaborate support.


Plan: PACT SW will continue to assess needs and provide support in conjunction with unit sw.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
