   SOCIAL WORK PROGRESS RECORD 







PATIENT NAME: Adam Templeton
CHOP MRN#: 56532642
DOB:  7/6/2020
TODAY'S DATE:  5/10/2023
TODAY'S TIME:  10:42 AM




Progress: 
SW stopped by bedside as SW was made aware that family had some concerns about their move to 5E. Patient's grandmother was bedside and expressed the family's concern of the patient being moved to 5E instead on to the CCU as they were previously told. Though grandmother shared that her nurse is great and they have not had any problems so far, they would just like some clarity as to why they were not transferred to the CCU. Grandmother also wanted to make sure that 5E is a cardiology floor, in which SW shared that 5E does include cardiology. Grandmother also shared that the patient is showing signs of a cold and wanted to talk to the FLC about this all. SW shared she will inform the team.


Grandmom also informed SW that though their roommate is great and helpful, the family ultimately feels bad that the patient is possibly keeping the other patient awake due to his constant crying of pain. Grandmom is hoping to see if there was any way to look into moving into another room if possible. SW shared she will inquire with the Charge Nurse.
SW assessed for additional needs or questions at this time and grandmother shared that was all. SW encouraged grandmother to reach out if any additional needs arise.


Plan: 
SW will inform the team of the family's questions/concerns.
SW will continue to provide support to patient and family while on the ITCU.


Time Spent: 30 minutes


Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
