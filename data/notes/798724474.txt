Progress: SW met with patient's mother in SW office. Mom talked with SW about the different struggles currently going on in her life and this SW validated her feeling and offered emotional support. Mom brought up financial concerns and this SW is going to look into seeing if any financial foundations are open and available to mom. Mom also had concerns about patient not being active on insurance. Mom reported that she spoke with the PA medicaid change center but there is some mix up and patient is not added. This SW stated that she would have someone here look into the medicaid system to see if patient is active, if he is not, then this SW and mom will discuss what to do next. Mom had no other questions or concerns at this time.
