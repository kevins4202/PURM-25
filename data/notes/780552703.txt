Progress: SW, CM and Continuity RN met with grandmother, Latiya Jones, to discuss disposition planning for patient. Grandmother would really like to train and take patient home.  SW explained that due to lack of training progress, referrals will be made to transitional care centers to allow family additional time to complete electrical work and train. Grandmother is aware that team has had difficulty engaging with mother. Grandmom stated that she thought mom was coming to see patient but has since learned otherwise. Grandmom believes mom has been with patient's father, who has not been involved with patient. Grandmother is hopeful that she and great grandmother can be identified caregivers and will be able to train. Discussed completing training calendars and other requirements before patient can be discharged. Grandmother stated that mom is supposed to be visiting today.
