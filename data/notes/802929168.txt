Social Work Care Plan Note


Patient's Name:  Yaseen K Algarhy 
Date of Birth:  8/7/2008 
MRN:  55118447


Progress: SW reviewed the emails Mom forwarded from the PA Vital Records. It appears that Mom's request was canceled due missing identification documentation needed to complete the request for the BC. 


SW called Mom and spoke with her over the phone with an Arabic Interpreter (ID# 226204) and discussed the above. Mom requested assistance with uploading the documents needed to the portal. Mom sent SW a copy of her identification documents. SW uploaded them to the portal for review. 


Mom also sent SW a copy of Yaseen's Medicaid ID Card and his Social Security Card for IDS. SW will submit these once Mom receives the birth certificate. 


Mom asked about how Yaseen is doing and shared that she plans to visit Friday or this weekend.


Plan: SW will continue to follow. IDS registration pending Birth Certificate. BC request is pending.


Time Spent: 30 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
