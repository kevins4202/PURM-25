Outcome: Ongoing


Progress:  SW reached out to dad to follow up with sign out from nursing that dad might need more information/ support surrounding interpreter services and overall understanding of medical updates.  Dad's phone was turned off today.  SW reached out to CYS case worker who noted that there will be a custody hearing on 5/2 and disposition for baby is helpful for overall planning/ support.  SW facilitated FLC providing CYS caseworker with medical update.  Noting likelihood of baby going home without any technology, while medically fragile, will likely only require neurosurgery and ophthalmology follow up doctors appointments.  Discussed potential for baby to continue to need weeks to months in the hospital for eye monitoring/ intervention/ surgery.  CYS case worker appreciated update.


Plan: SW will continue to provide support during hospitalization and reach out to dad again tomorrow.


Time Spent: 60 minutes
Acuity: Level 2 - Require information / education / recommendations / advance planning
